**Last Updated: 2025-08-08**

## Recent Accomplishments

### PWA Enhancements
- ✅ Replaced emoji icons with elegant SVG icons in PWA footer navigation
- ✅ Made footer navbar flush to bottom with sophisticated glass morphism effect
- ✅ Fixed PWA navigation to stay within app (no browser triggers)
- ✅ Removed hamburger menu in PWA standalone mode
- ✅ Made clear chat button flush with right edge
- ✅ Redesigned chat layout with elegant full-width messages

### PWA Icon Design
- ✅ Created "Th" periodic table element style icon (like Thorium)
- ✅ THRIVE yellow background (#FFD700) with glass morphism effects
- ✅ Generated all required icon sizes (16, 32, 120, 152, 167, 180, 192, 512px)
- ✅ Fixed text sizing for readability at all icon sizes
- ✅ Updated manifest.json with all icon references

## Current State
- Main branch is clean and up to date
- All changes committed and working
- PWA is fully functional with elegant design
- Chat interface has improved mobile UX

## Technical Notes
- Using SVG icons for better scaling and crisp display
- Glass morphism effects throughout for premium feel
- Dark theme with yellow accents maintained consistently
- PWA navigation properly handles same-origin links

## Known Issues
- Drag-and-drop image functionality in Claude Code needs permissions fix on new machine (Warp terminal needs Full Disk Access and Accessibility permissions)

## Next Steps (Suggested)
- Consider adding PWA footer nav to other main pages (home, game, coaching, etc.)
- Test PWA installation on various devices
- Consider adding haptic feedback for mobile interactions
- Optimize performance for slower devices
