                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <h4>Why Thrive Does NOT Meet Medical Device Definition</h4>
                        <p><strong>Under UK Medical Device Regulations 2002 (as amended) and MHRA guidance, a medical device must have a medical purpose including diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment, or alleviation of disease.</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Thrive does NOT meet this definition because:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="checkbox-list">
                            <li><strong>Does not diagnose medical conditions:</strong> Thrive does not assess, identify, or diagnose mental health disorders or any medical conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>Does not treat medical conditions:</strong> Thrive does not provide treatment for diagnosed mental health conditions or medical diseases</li>
                            <li><strong>Does not prevent disease:</strong> Thrive does not claim to prevent the onset of mental health disorders or medical conditions</li>
                            <li><strong>Does not monitor physiological processes:</strong> Thrive does not measure, monitor, or track physiological parameters for medical purposes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Regulatory Position:</strong> Wellness and personal development tool supporting general mental wellbeing, not a medical device.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Our position is based on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Medical Device Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/618, as amended)</li>
                        <li>MHRA Guidance on medical device stand-alone software (including apps)</li>
                        <li>EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 (applicable during transition period)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Key Differentiators:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Thrive provides educational content, not medical advice</li>
                        <li>Users self-direct their use; no clinical assessment or diagnosis occurs</li>
                        <li>Content supports general wellness, not treatment of pathology</li>
                        <li>No medical claims made in marketing or user communications</li>
                        <li>Clear disclaimers inform users Thrive is not a substitute for medical care</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Note:</strong> While Thrive is not a medical device, we maintain high standards of user safety, data protection, and ethical practice consistent with our commitment to user wellbeing.

                    <h3>5.2 Limitations Acknowledged</h3>

                    <p>Thrive is committed to transparency about the limitations of our evidence base and service. We openly acknowledge:</p>

                    <h4>Research Limitations:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Translation from in-person to digital:</strong> Most foundational research (e.g., CBT, positive psychology) was conducted on in-person interventions. While digital adaptations show promise, outcomes may differ from face-to-face delivery.</li>

                        <li><strong>Self-guided nature and variable engagement:</strong> Digital self-help tools depend on user engagement and self-direction. Research shows variable completion rates and outcomes based on individual motivation and circumstances.</li>

                        <li><strong>Population differences:</strong> Research conducted on specific populations (e.g., clinical samples, students) may not generalize to all Thrive users (workplace employees with varied backgrounds and needs).</li>

                        <li><strong>Limited Thrive-specific outcome data:</strong> <span class="placeholder">[As a [new/growing] service, Thrive's own outcome data is [limited/emerging]. While based on evidence-based principles, specific efficacy data for the Thrive platform is [in development/being collected].]</span></li>

                        <li><strong>Absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for Thrive:</strong> <span class="placeholder">[INSERT STATUS - e.g., Thrive has not yet been evaluated in RCTs. While content is based on RCT-supported approaches, the specific platform has not undergone gold-standard experimental evaluation.]</span></li>

                        <li><strong>Scope limitations:</strong> Thrive is designed for general wellbeing and mild-to-moderate stress, not clinical treatment. Research on clinical interventions may not directly apply to our wellness focus.</li>

                        <li><strong><span class="placeholder">[OTHER LIMITATIONS - e.g., outcome measurement challenges, attribution difficulties in complex interventions, long-term follow-up data]</span></strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Transparency in Communications:</h4>
                    <p>We communicate these limitations clearly:</p>
                    <ul class="checkbox-list">
                        <li><strong>No over-claiming:</strong> Marketing and user communications accurately represent what evidence does and doesn't show</li>
                        <li><strong>Honest about unknowns:</strong> Where evidence is limited or uncertain, we acknowledge this rather than making unsupported claims</li>
                        <li><strong>Context provided:</strong> When citing research, we explain how it applies (and doesn't apply) to Thrive's specific approach</li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing evaluation communicated:</strong> Users and partners informed about our commitment to outcome measurement and continuous improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual variation acknowledged:</strong> Communications emphasize that outcomes vary based on individual circumstances, engagement, and needs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <strong>Commitment to Evidence:</strong> Despite limitations, Thrive remains committed to evidence-based practice. We continuously review emerging research, collect outcome data, and refine our approach based on best available evidence and user feedback.

                        <li><strong>Clear handoff message:</strong> "You'll be contacted by Smart Start Minds within 48 hours. SSM is a separate clinical service providing professional therapy. You can continue using Thrive's wellness resources alongside SSM therapy if you wish."</li>
