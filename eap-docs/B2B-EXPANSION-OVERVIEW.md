## 2. B2B EAP Expansion: Strategic Rationale

### Why B2B?
The workplace mental health market is growing rapidly:
- UK employers increasingly required to provide mental health support (Health & Safety at Work Act 1974)
- EAP market valued at £500m+ in UK, projected to grow 15% annually
- Large corporates (1,000+ employees) seeking comprehensive wellbeing solutions
- Insurance brokers (e.g., Towergate) bundling mental health into employee benefits packages

### Target Markets
1. **Direct corporate clients:** Mid-to-large employers (500-5,000 employees)
2. **Insurance brokers:** Towergate (260,000+ employees across client companies), AXA, Aviva
3. **EAP providers:** White-label partnerships with existing EAP platforms
4. **Benefits consultancies:** Integration into employee benefits ecosystems

### Our Competitive Advantage
- **Clinical hypnotherapy focus:** Differentiated from generic EAP counselling
- **Proven at scale:** 70k B2C users demonstrate platform reliability
- **Cost-effective:** Digital-first model enables competitive PEPM pricing
- **CQC-compliant:** Full regulatory compliance for healthcare service provision (see Section 4)

---

## 3. Platform Architecture: B2C vs B2B

### Shared Technology Foundation
Both B2C and B2B offerings use the same core platform:
- Content delivery infrastructure (hypnotherapy sessions, wellness content)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- User authentication and data security
- Payment processing and subscription management

### B2B-Specific Enhancements
The B2B EAP platform adds enterprise features:
- **SSO integration** (SAML 2.0, OAuth) for corporate identity providers
- **Admin portal** for HR teams to manage employee access
- **Bulk provisioning** for rapid onboarding of thousands of employees
- **Advanced reporting** (anonymized, GDPR-compliant engagement metrics)
- **White-label branding** for Enterprise tier clients
- **API integrations** with HRIS systems (Workday, BambooHR, etc.)

### Operational Separation
While the platforms share technology, they are **operationally distinct**:
- **B2C:** Consumer-facing app, individual subscriptions, self-service
- **B2B:** HR-managed access, corporate contracts, account management, clinical governance

This separation ensures:
- Clear compliance boundaries (CQC regulations apply to B2B service delivery)
- Different pricing models (B2C subscription vs B2B PEPM)
- Tailored customer support (B2C help desk vs B2B account managers)

## 4. Regulatory Compliance Framework

### Why We Have Enterprise-Grade Policies

## 9. Team Implications

### Why This Matters for Everyone

**Product/Engineering:**

- Focus on enterprise integrations and compliance tooling

**Clinical/Content:**

- CQC compliance adds quality assurance layer

**Customer Success:**
- B2C: Help desk for individual users
- B2B: Account management for HR teams + support for employees
- Different skill sets (consumer support vs enterprise partnership management)

**Finance/Legal:**
- B2C: Individual subscriptions, app store fees
- B2B: Contract negotiation, DPAs, invoicing corporate clients
- Compliance costs (certifications, audits, insurance)

**Marketing:**
- B2C: Performance marketing, app store optimization
- B2B: Partnership sales, RFP responses, thought leadership, regulatory credibility

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

### Key Risks

**1. Regulatory Risk**
- **Risk:** CQC inspection finds compliance gaps
- **Mitigation:** 41 comprehensive policies, clinical supervision framework, annual reviews

**2. Security Risk**
- **Risk:** Data breach damages B2B reputation
- **Mitigation:** Cyber Essentials Plus, pen testing, ISO 27001 roadmap, cyber insurance

**3. Scaling Risk**
- **Risk:** B2B growth strains platform (e.g., Towergate's 260k employees)
- **Mitigation:** B2C proves we've already scaled to 70k users; infrastructure is ready

- **Risk:** B2B sales cycle longer than expected
- **Mitigation:** B2C revenue provides runway; dual revenue streams reduce dependency

**5. Brand Confusion**
