            <h3>⚠️ Important Notice: Individual Results May Vary</h3>
            <p><strong>ClearMinds makes no guarantees regarding the results you may or may not achieve through using our hypnotherapy services.</strong> Outcomes depend on numerous individual factors and vary significantly from person to person.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. No Guaranteed Outcomes</h2>

        <h3>1.1 What We Do NOT Guarantee</h3>
        <p>ClearMinds does <strong>not</strong> guarantee, promise, or warrant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Specific results</strong> – Such as reduced stress, improved sleep, weight loss, smoking cessation, or any other specific outcome</li>
            <li><strong>Timeframes for results</strong> – How quickly (if at all) you may notice benefits</li>
            <li><strong>Permanent changes</strong> – The durability or longevity of any benefits experienced</li>
            <li><strong>Universal effectiveness</strong> – That our services will work for everyone</li>
            <li><strong>Medical outcomes</strong> – Improvement in any medical or mental health condition</li>

            <li><strong>Financial gains</strong> – Increased income, productivity, or economic benefit</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Factors Affecting Results</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Individual Differences</h3>
        <p>Your results from using ClearMinds may be influenced by many individual factors, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal commitment and consistency</strong> – How regularly and consistently you use the services</li>
            <li><strong>Individual responsiveness to hypnotherapy</strong> – Some people are more responsive to hypnotic suggestion than others</li>
            <li><strong>Current mental and physical health status</strong> – Underlying health conditions may affect outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Life circumstances</strong> – Stress levels, life events, social support, and environmental factors</li>
            <li><strong>Expectations and beliefs</strong> – Your mindset and openness to the process</li>
            <li><strong>Concurrent treatments or interventions</strong> – Other therapies, medications, or lifestyle changes</li>
            <li><strong>Age, health history, and genetics</strong> – Biological and developmental factors</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation and goals</strong> – Clarity of purpose and personal drive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Hypnotic Susceptibility</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Research shows that individuals vary widely in their responsiveness to hypnotic suggestion. Approximately <strong>10-15% of people are highly susceptible</strong> to hypnosis, while <strong>10-15% show minimal response</strong>. Most people fall somewhere in between. Your individual level of hypnotic susceptibility will significantly affect your experience and outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Testimonials and Case Studies</h2>

        <h3>3.1 User Testimonials</h3>
        <p>Any testimonials, reviews, or user experiences shared by ClearMinds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Represent individual experiences only</strong> – They are not representative of all users</li>
            <li><strong>Are not guarantees of similar results</strong> – Your experience may be completely different</li>
            <li><strong>May use pseudonyms</strong> – To protect user privacy (as stated in Terms of Service)</li>
            <li><strong>May not reflect typical outcomes</strong> – Positive testimonials may represent best-case scenarios</li>
            <li><strong>Are provided voluntarily</strong> – Users may have been motivated to share particularly positive experiences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Statistics and Research</h3>
        <p>Any statistics, research findings, or data referenced by ClearMinds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relate to general hypnotherapy research</strong> – Not necessarily to ClearMinds specifically</li>
            <li><strong>Reflect average or aggregate data</strong> – Individual outcomes vary widely around averages</li>
            <li><strong>May not apply to your situation</strong> – Research participants may differ from you in significant ways</li>
            <li><strong>Are subject to study limitations</strong> – All research has methodological constraints and context-specific findings</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Past performance is not indicative of future results.</strong> The fact that other users have reported benefits does not mean you will experience similar outcomes.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Required Effort and Commitment</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Active Participation Required</h3>
        <p>Hypnotherapy is <strong>not a passive process</strong>. Results, if achieved, typically require:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regular, consistent use</strong> – Daily or frequent practice over weeks or months</li>
            <li><strong>Active engagement</strong> – Full attention and participation during sessions</li>
            <li><strong>Openness and willingness</strong> – A receptive mindset and genuine desire for change</li>
            <li><strong>Integration of learnings</strong> – Applying insights and techniques in daily life</li>
            <li><strong>Patience and persistence</strong> – Allowing time for gradual changes to occur</li>
            <li><strong>Self-reflection and awareness</strong> – Monitoring your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.2 No "Quick Fix"</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>ClearMinds is not a "quick fix" or "miracle cure."</strong> While some users may notice benefits relatively quickly, lasting change typically requires sustained effort, practice, and personal commitment over an extended period.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Workplace Wellness Context</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Employer-Provided Access</h3>
        <p>If you are accessing ClearMinds through your employer as a workplace wellness benefit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of workplace outcomes</strong> – Such as reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, or better job performance</li>
            <li><strong>Individual results only</strong> – Aggregate data provided to employers shows anonymised trends, not individual outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Not a substitute for workplace support</strong> – ClearMinds does not replace occupational health services, HR support, or professional development</li>
            <li><strong>Voluntary participation</strong> – Using ClearMinds is your choice; results depend on your personal engagement</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Organisational Benefits Claims</h3>
        <p>Any claims made to employers about organisational benefits (e.g., reduced stress-related absence, improved employee wellbeing) are based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aggregate, anonymised data</strong> – Not individual employee outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Self-reported measures</strong> – User feedback and engagement metrics</li>
            <li><strong>General research on hypnotherapy</strong> – Not controlled studies of ClearMinds specifically</li>
            <li><strong>Correlational data</strong> – Not definitive proof of causation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. No Medical or Clinical Claims</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Wellness, Not Treatment</h3>
        <p>ClearMinds is a <strong>wellness and personal development platform</strong>, not a medical or therapeutic treatment service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We do not claim to treat, cure, or diagnose</strong> any medical or mental health condition</li>
            <li><strong>Hypnotherapy is complementary</strong> – It may support general wellbeing but is not a replacement for professional medical care</li>
            <li><strong>No clinical outcomes guaranteed</strong> – Such as remission of symptoms, reduced medication use, or medical improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Always consult healthcare professionals</strong> – For medical or mental health concerns (see Medical Disclaimer)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Changes Over Time</h2>

        <h3>7.1 Non-Linear Progress</h3>
        <p>If you do experience benefits from ClearMinds, progress may be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Non-linear</strong> – With ups and downs, not steady improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Gradual and subtle</strong> – Small changes over time rather than dramatic shifts</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary or fluctuating</strong> – Benefits may come and go or require ongoing practice to maintain</li>
            <li><strong>Context-dependent</strong> – More noticeable in some situations than others</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>7.2 Maintenance and Continuation</h3>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Any benefits you experience may diminish or disappear if you stop using ClearMinds.</strong> Like physical exercise, the benefits of hypnotherapy and meditation often require ongoing practice to maintain.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <h3>8.1 Partner Referrals</h3>
        <p>ClearMinds may provide information about or referrals to third-party services (therapists, coaches, medical professionals):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of third-party results</strong> – We are not responsible for outcomes from third-party services</li>
            <li><strong>Informational purposes only</strong> – Referrals are suggestions, not endorsements or guarantees</li>
            <li><strong>Independent relationships</strong> – Any engagement with third parties is your responsibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Refund Policy</h2>

        <h3>9.1 No Results-Based Refunds</h3>
        <p>Because results are highly individual and cannot be guaranteed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Refunds are not provided based on lack of results</strong> – See our Terms of Service for our refund policy</li>
            <li><strong>Satisfaction is subjective</strong> – We provide access to services, not guaranteed outcomes</li>
            <li><strong>Fair usage applies</strong> – Our refund policy (if applicable) is based on service delivery, not individual outcomes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClearMinds and its directors, officers, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failure to achieve desired results or outcomes</li>
                <li>Time, effort, or resources invested without achieving results</li>
                <li>Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to achieve results</li>
                <li>Decisions made or actions taken based on expected outcomes that did not materialise</li>
                <li>Any financial, professional, personal, or other losses related to using our services</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <h2>11. Managing Expectations</h2>

        <h3>11.1 Realistic Expectations</h3>
        <p>To make the most of ClearMinds, we recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Approach with curiosity, not expectation</strong> – Be open to whatever your experience may be</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on the process, not outcomes</strong> – Engage fully with each session without attachment to specific results</li>
            <li><strong>Be patient with yourself</strong> – Change, if it occurs, often happens gradually</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with other healthy practices</strong> – Hypnotherapy works best as part of a holistic approach to wellbeing</li>
            <li><strong>Seek professional support when needed</strong> – If you're struggling, consult qualified professionals (see Medical Disclaimer)</li>
        </ul>
