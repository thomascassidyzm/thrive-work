            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Element</th>

                    <li><strong>Control and safety:</strong> Service user remains in control, can emerge at any time, cannot be made to do anything against their will</li>
                    <li><strong>Potential reactions:</strong> Emotional release, abreaction (reliving traumatic memory), temporary drowsiness</li>
                    <li><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Screen for epilepsy, psychosis, severe mental illness (hypnotherapy may not be appropriate)</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>5.1 Hypnotherapy Consent Checklist</h3>
            <p>Before commencing hypnotherapy, therapist must confirm:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✓ Service user understands what hypnotherapy involves</li>
                <li>✓ Service user given opportunity to ask questions</li>

            <h2>6. Mental Capacity Act 2005 – Assessing Capacity</h2>

            <h3>6.1 The Five Statutory Principles</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Presumption of capacity:</strong> A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that they lack capacity.</li>
                <li><strong>Support to make decisions:</strong> A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help them have been taken without success.</li>
                <li><strong>Unwise decisions:</strong> A person is not to be treated as lacking capacity merely because they make an unwise decision.</li>
                <li><strong>Best interests:</strong> Any act done or decision made for someone who lacks capacity must be in their best interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Least restrictive option:</strong> Before the act is done or decision is made, consideration must be given to whether the purpose can be achieved in a less restrictive way.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>6.2 When to Assess Capacity</h3>
            <p>Capacity assessment should be considered when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Service user has cognitive impairment, learning disability, or brain injury</li>
                <li>Service user has severe mental illness affecting insight or reasoning</li>
                <li>Service user appears confused, disoriented, or unable to retain information</li>
                <li>Service user's decisions seem inconsistent, fluctuating, or very unusual</li>
                <li>Concerns raised by family, employer, or other professionals</li>
                <li>Service user unable to engage meaningfully in therapeutic process</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Capacity is decision-specific and time-specific. A person may have capacity to make some decisions but not others. Capacity can fluctuate.</p>

            <h3>6.3 The Two-Stage Test of Capacity</h3>

            <h4>Stage 1: Is there an impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, the person's mind or brain?</h4>
            <p>This could be due to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mental health condition (depression, anxiety, psychosis, dementia)</li>
                <li>Learning disability</li>
                <li>Brain injury or neurological condition</li>
                <li>Substance intoxication or withdrawal</li>
                <li>Temporary factors (shock, trauma, extreme distress)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If <strong>NO</strong>, person has capacity. If <strong>YES</strong>, proceed to Stage 2.</p>

            <h4>Stage 2: Does the impairment mean the person is unable to make the specific decision at the time it needs to be made?</h4>
            <p>Person lacks capacity if they cannot do <strong>one or more</strong> of the following:</p>

            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Capacity Component</th>
                        <th>What This Means</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>1. Understand information</strong></td>
                        <td>Can the person understand the information relevant to the decision? (Explained in appropriate way for their level)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>2. Retain information</strong></td>
                        <td>Can they retain the information long enough to make the decision? (Even if only for a short time)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>3. Weigh information</strong></td>
                        <td>Can they weigh up the information (consider pros/cons, benefits/risks) to arrive at a choice?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>4. Communicate decision</strong></td>
                        <td>Can they communicate their decision by any means (talking, writing, signing, gestures)?</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>6.4 Conducting a Capacity Assessment</h3>
            <p>If you need to assess capacity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose the right time and place:</strong> Quiet, comfortable, no distractions; person at their best (not tired, intoxicated, distressed)</li>
                <li><strong>Explain the decision:</strong> What is the decision? Why does it need to be made?</li>
                <li><strong>Provide information:</strong> Clear, simple language; visual aids if helpful; break down complex information</li>
                <li><strong>Ask questions:</strong> Can you explain back to me what we've discussed? What are the options? What might happen if you choose option A/B?</li>
                <li><strong>Allow time:</strong> Don't rush; give person time to think and process</li>
                <li><strong>Document assessment:</strong> Record what information given, questions asked, person's responses, conclusion reached</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>If in doubt, seek advice:</strong> Consult Clinical Director, GP, or mental capacity specialist.</p>

            <h2>7. Best Interests Decision-Making</h2>

            <h3>7.1 When to Make Best Interests Decisions</h3>
            <p>If a person is assessed as lacking capacity to consent to therapy or a specific intervention, a decision must be made in their <strong>best interests</strong> under the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

            <h3>7.2 Best Interests Checklist</h3>
            <p>When making a best interests decision, the decision-maker must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not make assumptions:</strong> Based on age, appearance, condition, or behaviour</li>
                <li><strong>Consider all relevant circumstances</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Will the person regain capacity?</strong> If so, can decision wait?</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage participation:</strong> Support person to be involved as much as possible</li>
                <li><strong>Not be motivated by desire to bring about death</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Ascertain person's wishes and feelings:</strong> Past and present, written or verbal</li>
                <li><strong>Consider beliefs and values:</strong> Cultural, religious, personal beliefs</li>
                <li><strong>Consider other factors:</strong> What would influence person if they had capacity?</li>
                <li><strong>Consult others:</strong> Family, friends, carers, attorney, deputy, advocate, professionals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.3 Best Interests Decisions in ClearMinds Context</h3>
            <p>For ClearMinds, best interests decisions might involve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether to proceed with therapy for someone with fluctuating capacity</li>
                <li>Sharing information with family or carer (where person lacks capacity to consent to information sharing)</li>
                <li>Choosing alternative therapeutic approach if person cannot engage with planned intervention</li>
                <li>Referring to more appropriate service if person lacks capacity to benefit from therapy</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Best interests decisions must be documented. ClearMinds therapists should consult Clinical Director before proceeding with treatment where capacity is in doubt.</p>

            <h2>8. Advance Decisions and Lasting Powers of Attorney</h2>

            <h3>8.1 Advance Decisions to Refuse Treatment</h3>
            <p>An <strong>advance decision</strong> (formerly "living will") is a decision made by someone aged 18+ with capacity, to refuse specific treatment in the future when they lack capacity to consent.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Must be valid and applicable to the circumstances</li>
                <li>If valid and applicable, must be followed (as if person has capacity and is refusing)</li>
                <li>Advance decisions cannot demand specific treatment, only refuse it</li>
                <li>Unlikely to be relevant to ClearMinds therapy services, but therapist should ask if person has one</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8.2 Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for Health and Welfare</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)</strong> allows someone to appoint another person (attorney) to make decisions on their behalf if they lose capacity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health and Welfare LPA:</strong> Covers healthcare decisions, including consent to/refusal of treatment</li>
                <li>Only takes effect when person lacks capacity</li>
                <li>Attorney must act in person's best interests</li>
                <li>If service user has LPA, therapist should involve attorney in consent discussions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8.3 Court-Appointed Deputy</h3>
            <p>Court of Protection may appoint a deputy to make decisions for someone who lacks capacity. Deputy has similar role to LPA attorney. If service user has a deputy, involve them in decision-making.</p>

            <h2>9. Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)</h2>
            <p>An <strong>IMCA</strong> is appointed to support someone who lacks capacity, has no family or friends to consult, and faces a serious decision (serious medical treatment or change of accommodation).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IMCA represents and supports person in decision-making process</li>
                <li>Unlikely to be required for routine therapy, but may be relevant if serious decisions needed (e.g., sharing safeguarding concerns)</li>
                <li>Referral to IMCA service via local authority</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Consent and Workplace EAP Context</h2>

            <h3>10.1 Voluntary Participation</h3>
            <p>ClearMinds services are accessed via employer EAP schemes. It is critical that service users understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participation is <strong>voluntary</strong> – they are not obliged to use ClearMinds services</li>
                <li>Declining therapy will not affect employment or be reported to employer</li>
                <li>They can withdraw from therapy at any time</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="critical-box">
                <h3>Screening for Coercion or Pressure</h3>
                <p>Therapists must be alert to situations where service user may feel pressured to attend therapy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manager has "suggested" or "strongly encouraged" therapy</li>
                    <li>Service user attends reluctantly or under duress</li>
                    <li>Service user believes attendance is monitored by employer (reassure: only attendance reported, not content)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Action:</strong> Clarify voluntary nature of therapy; explore service user's own goals and wishes; offer alternative support if appropriate.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>10.2 Information Sharing with Employers</h3>
            <p>Service users must consent to what information is shared with their employer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Attendance data only:</strong> Employer informed service user is accessing support (not clinical content)</li>
                <li><strong>No clinical information:</strong> Details of sessions, diagnoses, treatment, or personal issues are <strong>never</strong> shared without explicit consent</li>
                <li><strong>Exception – safeguarding/risk:</strong> If serious risk to service user or others, information may be shared without consent (in line with Safeguarding Policy)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Consent from Young People (16-17 Year Olds)</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>16-17 year olds can consent to medical treatment (including therapy) if they have capacity</li>
                <li>Assess capacity using same MCA principles</li>
                <li>Encourage involvement of parents/carers where appropriate, but young person's consent is primary</li>
                <li>Enhanced safeguarding considerations apply</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>12. Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
            <p>Service users have the right to withdraw consent at any time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>During a session:</strong> Therapist must stop immediately if service user withdraws consent or appears distressed</li>
                <li><strong>Between sessions:</strong> Service user can decide not to continue therapy; therapist should explore reasons and offer support or alternatives</li>
                <li><strong>Withdrawal for specific interventions:</strong> E.g., no longer wishes to do hypnotherapy but continues with talking therapy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Withdrawal of consent must be documented. Therapist should ensure ending is managed appropriately (not abrupt abandonment).</p>
