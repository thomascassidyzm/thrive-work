                        In the UK, an employee can insist on reasonable adjustments for a condition that has not been formally diagnosed. The legal duty under the Equality Act 2010 focuses on the <strong>effects of a physical or mental impairment, not on a formal diagnosis</strong>, which means that the employer should not use the lack of a formal diagnosis as a reason to do nothing. They must focus on the effect of the impairment on the employee's work.

                        In the context of UK reasonable adjustments law, an employer <strong>"ought reasonably to know"</strong> about an employee's disability if they have received enough information to be put on notice of a potential issue, even if they were not explicitly told.
