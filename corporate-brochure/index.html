                With combined experience spanning decades, we have brought together leading experts in Psychology and Psychiatry.

            <p class="content-text">
                We begin with a simple assessment questionnaire which reveals behavioral patterns, and we provide guidance and pointers based on what is shared. So if, for example, an individual talks about poor sleep and anxiety, we know how to help in these areas with ready-made solutions including a highly effective hypnotherapy app which is supported by clinical psychologists and has the fastest growing global community of users—see clearminds.com

            <p class="content-text">
                We also provide the employer with an <strong>anonymised, categorised list of the most prominent issues</strong> that surface, which can help managers think about the environment, meeting structures, and how best to communicate support in general to the workforce.

                    In the UK, an employee can insist on reasonable adjustments for a condition that has not been formally diagnosed. The legal duty under the Equality Act 2010 focuses on the <strong>effects of a physical or mental impairment, not on a formal diagnosis</strong>—which means that the employer should not use the lack of a formal diagnosis as a reason to do nothing. They must focus on the effect of the impairment on the employee's work.
