Sunday – 26th Oct 25






Dear all, 


As discussed 1 to 1 and now with all:


Some of this below will form part of the spoken narrative when we meet with Iain and team. 


For example, whether Iain wants to know or not, I am certain other companies will want to be assured that C.M b to b is planning to be around for a long time rather than make a fast buck and sell!


Part of our narrative ( in not so many words) will be to highlight what can happen when a company tries to grow fast with investors - and it's invariably customer service and therefore customers who are let down - soft ref to Headspace which Sarita has already highlighted and so i won’t mention by name, but she may well do ;) and that's fine


So we are saying that we are driven by the desire - and the results - of having a transformative impact with mental health and well being and the workforce needs guided support with clear pathways - self directed - more than at any time since the 1st individual revolution; the tech revision of which we are on our third! Having a major detrimental effect as much as it is a force for good ( I have the words for that)


The biggest issue facing all companies of almost all sizes is ‘uncertainty’ which itself is driving diffused communication to workers (as they don’t know the answers or at times the exact way ahead) and this is driving anxieties around job security, progression and linked to this , affordability and so on. Even when my own workforce knew we were navigating a downturn in the sector, however it stopped none of them approaching me directly for pay rises with the simple point: I need more money and it’s stressing me and my family out. Some hit the booze and others just got mentally unwell….


Also as soon as there is a hint of a restructure - everyone panics and rumours take over the truth - most companies are font through this also, now.


AI is and will continue to take jobs. There is a tsunami of unemployment coming and people know this - it is derin-ving fear into the workforce


People who decided to work from home are struggling and many can’t return as employers have let buildings go


Could go in but we have the key points for conversation , if and as needed - all of which should resonate rather than grate , if this makes sense




So, we are in for the long haul, we actively decided against investment for fast growth for reasons highlighted. This will give assurance to Iain and any other B to B customer in this regard.


The market ‘hypnotherapy’ is expanding exponentially and is predicted to go from $15Bn to $131Bn in the next 7 years. It is being driven / accelerated by mobile apps and AI ( this is us)


So whilst the app market is itself far smaller , our point is that we have set sights and targets calibrated to our values and knowledge of what it takes to invest in a client's success and for this we have to concentrate effort and focus on a relatively small number.. We can discuss this point.




======================================================================


Vision + start of business plan extract (the core aspects for B to B)


The computer keeps locking – so I am sharing doc to mitigate risk of losing text – it’s still being worked on at the moment however…




High level summary of ‘why’  which = vision and values


The founding vision of Clear Minds was, and remains to this day, a community first approach. The company was launched in 2021, amidst the pandemic and in the immediate aftermath, as most of us found ourselves trying to find and fit with a ‘new normalcy’ it presented a seismic shift in how we work and live. For some, this involved a whole new work-life rebalance and for others it entailed new work patterns and working from home. For almost everyone affected, these changes came with their own challenges; ones which brought to the conscious mind, how we live and work and the need to address things which appeared to be affecting us and disrupting our balance.


The explosion of wearable tech which then followed, would constantly tell us if we were not sleeping or if we were anxious but would not venture a solution or help. What followed was increasing demand for psychological support and medical intervention, all of which also came with challenges from cost to availability, as well as the fundamental issue of ‘where to start’.


These factors have shaped the strategy of Clear Minds and by 2023/24 with the emerging patterns and challenges becoming ever clearer, we knew that it was time to take the established product and the power of community, directly into the workforce.


As we opened discussions with experienced professionals, supported by our own experts with direct experience in highly regulated sectors, we could also see the compounding effect of AI and how this was causing even greater degrees of uncertainty and anxiety around job retention and progression. All of which was adding to the pressure on mental health, bleeding across work, life and family communities. 


Paradoxically at a time where communication between executives, managers and the wider workforce has become paramount, evolving legislation around disabilities and rights to reasonable adjustments has stopped many employers from opening discussions with employees who appear to be struggling. All of which [a]only served to widen the gap of trust-based communication which affects the underlying culture of any organisation.
































Financials – to become part of the business plan and still being worked on 
 This will be an  internal doc which we can give sight of, at the appropriate time to our B to B clients organisations.


 So, this will be a specific section: Market size, trend and growth potential


Ref: will be set out correctly – several..


  



  
 Metastatinsight - market research






The global market for hypnotherapy is currently circa $15Bn, with the largest growth sector being Europe. Market research bodies consistently predict that the market will grow to over $130Bn by 2032, partly due to the growing evidence of the effectiveness but also due to the technology revolution and the growth of the App market with AI accelerating development and streamlining delivery on demand.






The global growth of the app market for hypnotherapy is driven by three irreversible trends:


1 Accessibility on mobile.
On demand accessibility to therapy = convenience to the user and ‘zero guilt’ for skipping sessions: meditation requires a daily commitment and does not work effectively when sessions are skipped.






1 On demand access and Platform Ubiquity
* iOS and Android reach 99% of smartphone users globally
* Instant deployment to millions without physical infrastructure
* Technology adoption accelerating across all demographics


2. Proven Application Breadth
* Daily wellness: Stress reduction, mindfulness, resilience building
* Specific anxieties: Flight phobia, pregnancy support, performance anxiety, socialising
* Lasting change with better health outcomes: Insomnia, smoking cessation, weight management, PTSD
* Pain management: 




3. Why The soaring demand and need for support
* Mental health awareness at all-time high post-pandemic
* Acceptance of digital therapeutics as mainstream intervention
* Traditional talk therapy has 6-12 month waitlists globally
* Employers desperate for solutions that reduce healthcare costs and presenteeism
* Insurance industry actively seeking measurable ROI from mental health interventions






Metasta reports on the growing App market and names Clear Minds as one of just a few , global industry leaders.






Of the three leaders; Clear Minds, Riveri and Hello Minds, Nerva-IBS, only Clear Minds are focused on the UK health and insurance sector with the requisite experience and expertise and relationship managers. Of major importance, only Clear Minds has the community aspect which we believe to be the strongest most valuable factor.

The Compelling Proposition
Unlike meditation apps requiring ongoing daily practice for symptom management, clinically developed hypnotherapy delivers permanent pattern change by directly reprogramming neural pathways. Users achieve resolution in 6-18 hours of engagement, with effects that strengthen over time rather than requiring maintenance.
This isn't just wellness content—it's clinically backed intervention delivered at consumer convenience and enterprise scale.




Clear Minds' Position: Listed among global competitive players, positioned to leverage clinical hypnotherapy's fundamental advantage—permanent pattern change vs. ongoing symptom management—while competitors largely focus on user experience innovations rather than lasting outcomes.


For B2B positioning: While many offerings lace in technology gimmicks and user engagement metrics, Clear Minds offers what enterprises actually need: measurable outcomes that reduce long-term healthcare costs. The market is massive, fragmented, and ripe for consolidation by whoever demonstrates genuine clinical efficacy at scale. In an EAP context, this translates to resolution rather than referral—eliminating the downstream costs that make traditional EAPs a loss-leader for insurers.


1 Technology-led, research backed and evidence based, Clear Minds is available 24/7 and fits seamlessly into daily routines as well as on demand which is perfect for busy professionals and remote workers alike.
* Anonymised
* In app communication; available as one of many functions developed and ready for deployment, suited to the B to B market.
* takes a partnership approach based on human interaction to create customization of therapies with niche focus also, on brand-culture specific content creation.

Future developments


AI/ML personalization: Sessions adapt dynamically based on user data and physiological responses


Wearable integration: Real-time monitoring enables precision dosing and outcome tracking


Next-gen immersion: VR/AR innovations creating more effective hypnotic states – we should look at Tend – a VR co that I was about to work with at ACM.
