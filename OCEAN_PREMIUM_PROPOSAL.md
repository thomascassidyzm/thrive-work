### Technical Implementation:

```javascript
// Account creation after 10 questions
if (responses.length === 10 && !user.isLoggedIn) {
    showAccountOption({
        message: "Save your progress and unlock deep analysis",
        benefits: [
            "Complete 88-question assessment",
            "OCEAN personality profile",
            "Script identification report",
            "Sausage Machine action plan",
            "Personalized coaching pathway"
        ],
        price: "$20 one-time",
        continuation: "or continue free with basic analysis"
    });
}
```

### Why This Works:

1. **88 questions > Traditional OCEAN tests**
   - NEO-PI-R has 240 items but they're self-report
   - We have 88 behavioral scenarios (more revealing)
   - Each scenario reveals multiple OCEAN dimensions

2. **Script/Sausage Machine Lens = Unique Value**
   - Not just "you're 73% agreeable"
   - But "here's the Script making you say yes when you want to say no"
   - And "here's what to put in your sausage machine to change that"

3. **Session Saving = Better Data**
   - People can complete over multiple sessions
   - Less fatigue = more accurate responses
   - Track changes over time

### Coverage Comparison:

**Traditional OCEAN (NEO-PI-R):**
- 48 questions per dimension
- Self-report format
- Fixed trait language

**THRIVE Behavioral:**
- 88 scenarios covering all dimensions
- Behavioral choice format (more accurate)
- Dynamic "verb not noun" language
- Script identification
- Sausage Machine inputs
- Conscious choice emphasis

### Missing Coverage to Add:

To fully match traditional OCEAN, we could add scenarios for:

1. **Openness:**
   - Artistic appreciation scenarios
   - Fantasy/imagination choices
   - Intellectual curiosity situations

2. **Conscientiousness:**
   - Time management scenarios
   - Goal persistence situations
   - Order/cleanliness choices

3. **Extraversion:**
   - Energy level scenarios
   - Excitement seeking situations
   - Positive emotion choices

4. **Agreeableness:**
   - Trust scenarios
   - Modesty situations
   - Tender-mindedness choices

5. **Neuroticism:**
   - Vulnerability scenarios
   - Self-consciousness situations
   - Impulsiveness choices

With 20-30 more targeted scenarios, we'd have complete OCEAN coverage exceeding traditional tests.

## Next Steps:

1. Implement account creation flow
2. Build payment integration (Stripe)
3. Create report generation engine
4. Add 20-30 scenarios for complete coverage
5. Design beautiful PDF reports
6. Build progress saving system
