# About ClearMinds: Our Story & Vision

## The Founding Vision

The founding vision of ClearMinds was, and remains to this day, a **community-first approach**. The company was launched in 2021, amidst the pandemic and in the immediate aftermath, as most of us found ourselves trying to find and fit with a 'new normalcy'. This presented a seismic shift in how we work and live. For some, this involved a whole new work-life rebalance and for others it entailed new work patterns and working from home. For almost everyone affected, these changes came with their own challenges—ones which brought to the conscious mind how we live and work, and the need to address things which appeared to be affecting us and disrupting our balance.

The explosion of wearable tech which then followed would constantly tell us if we were not sleeping or if we were anxious, but would not venture a solution or help. What followed was increasing demand for psychological support and medical intervention, all of which also came with challenges from cost to availability, as well as the fundamental issue of **'where to start'**.

These factors have shaped the strategy of ClearMinds, and by 2023/24 with the emerging patterns and challenges becoming ever clearer, we knew that it was time to take the established product and the power of community directly into the workforce.

As we opened discussions with experienced professionals, supported by our own experts with direct experience in highly regulated sectors, we could also see the compounding effect of AI and how this was causing even greater degrees of uncertainty and anxiety around job retention and progression. All of which was adding to the pressure on mental health, bleeding across work, life, and family communities.

Paradoxically, at a time where communication between executives, managers, and the wider workforce has become paramount, evolving legislation around disabilities and rights to reasonable adjustments has stopped many employers from opening discussions with employees who appear to be struggling. This has only served to widen the gap of 'trust-based' communication which affects the underlying culture of any organisation. Employees have become wise to 'tick box' gestures for covering legislation. **This unique offer is authentic, proven, and ultimately, empowering for every mind.**

## Why We Chose Sustainable Growth Over Hypergrowth

### Our Deliberate Choice

Unlike many tech companies, ClearMinds has **deliberately chosen organic, sustainable growth over investor-backed hypergrowth**. Why?

**Quality over speed**: We've seen competitors sacrifice customer service and quality to chase rapid scaling. When investor pressure demands fast growth, it's invariably customers who are let down. That's not us.

**Long-term commitment**: Our B2B partners need assurance we'll be here for the long haul, not make a fast buck and sell. Venture-backed startups often exit, pivot, or shut down within 3-5 years. We're building for decades, not a quick sale.

**Customer-first investment**: Our revenue goes into what matters:
- Content creation by qualified clinical practitioners
- Dedicated relationship managers for every B2B client
- Co-created, culture-specific programmes tailored to your organisation
- Continuous improvement based on real user feedback, not investor metrics

**Proven at scale**: 70,000+ B2C users since 2021. Now bringing that battle-tested foundation to enterprise partnerships.

### The Market Opportunity is Massive

The global hypnotherapy market is currently **$15 billion**, predicted to grow to over **$131 billion by 2032**—driven by mobile accessibility, growing clinical evidence, and AI acceleration. The app market is expanding exponentially.

We're not trying to capture the whole market. We're focused on **sustainable market share calibrated to our values**: small enough to care, big enough to make a fundamental difference. **One mind at a time.**

## What Makes ClearMinds Different

### 1. Permanent Pattern Change, Not Symptom Management

**Unlike meditation apps** (Calm, Headspace) that require ongoing daily practice for symptom management:

**ClearMinds hypnotherapy** targets root causes by directly reprogramming neural pathways at the subconscious level. Typical engagement of 6-18 hours can deliver pattern change, with effects that strengthen over time rather than requiring daily maintenance.

**This isn't just wellness content—it's clinically backed intervention delivered at consumer convenience and enterprise scale.**

---

### 2. Community-First Since Day One

We're the **only hypnotherapy platform** with integrated peer support communities. Mental health isn't solved in isolation—it requires connection, shared experience, and mutual support.

**91,000 members. 4 years proven. 24/7 crisis-ready.**

Our professionally moderated community provides within-minutes response to members in crisis—we've safely supported members through suicidal ideation, self-harm distress, and severe mental health episodes **with zero incidents in 4 years**. Family members trust us enough to contact our moderators about loved ones in crisis.

Unlike meditation apps with no community (Calm, Headspace) or traditional EAPs that refer to external crisis helplines, **ClearMinds is the crisis support**—with professional moderation and persistent peer connection before, during, and after crisis moments.

**For B2B**: Secure, anonymous employee communities with 24/7 professional crisis management and industry-leading privacy protections (£10,000 per employee breach penalty—unprecedented in the EAP space).

### 3. Human Relationship Managers, Not Just Software

While AI has its place, it will not replace face-to-face, eye-level interactions which foster trust and enable collaboration to produce targeted solutions.

**Every B2B client gets**:
- Dedicated relationship manager
- Regular in-person check-ins and strategic planning
- Co-created content aligned to your company culture
- Partnership approach based on listening, shaping, and delivering exactly what's required

---

### 4. Full-Spectrum Clinical Pathways

**Three-tier stepped care model**:
1. **Self-directed wellness** (ClearMinds hypnotherapy, meditation, breathwork)
2. **Diagnostic insight** (AI-powered neuropsychological assessment via Concierge Health Advisors)
3. **Clinical treatment** (CQC-regulated mental health services, ADHD diagnostics, physical health screening via Concierge Health Advisors network)

**Resolution, not just referral.** This eliminates the downstream costs that make traditional EAPs a loss-leader for insurers.

---

### 5. Sector Expertise & Experience

**Six target industry sectors** with corresponding in-house expertise:
- Financial services (insurance, banking)
- Healthcare (NHS, private)
- Professional services (legal, consulting)
- Manufacturing & logistics
- Technology & startups
- Public sector

We understand your industry because we've worked in it. This isn't generic EAP—it's tailored support addressing workforce challenges specific to your sector.

## Our Vision: The Workforce Needs Guided Support

The workforce is facing unprecedented challenges:

**Uncertainty**: The biggest issue facing companies of almost all sizes is uncertainty itself, driving diffused communication which breeds anxiety around job security, progression, and affordability.

**AI displacement**: AI is and will continue to take jobs. There's a tsunami of unemployment coming, and people know this—it's driving fear into the workforce. Even when employees are secure, the constant adaptation and reskilling creates persistent low-level stress.

**Remote work isolation**: People who transitioned to remote work are struggling. Many can't return as employers have let buildings go. The loss of casual workplace connection compounds mental health challenges.

**Communication breakdown**: Paradoxically, at a time when trust-based communication is most needed, legislation around disabilities and adjustments has made managers afraid to ask "are you okay?" This widens the trust gap, eroding organisational culture.

**ClearMinds addresses this by**:
- Providing **self-directed support** (no need to ask manager for help)
- Building **secure peer communities** (connection without workplace hierarchy)
- Offering **clear clinical pathways** (when self-help isn't enough)
- Supporting **organisational wellbeing strategies** (not just individual symptoms)

## Our Commitment

*"At ClearMinds, we invest in the success of our B2B customers, which centres on culture and community and which requires the combined force of every individual mind."*

We're in this for the long haul. Our targets are realistic, our approach is human-first, and our commitment is absolute: **never overpromising and under-delivering.**

**Small enough to care. Big enough to make a transformative impact. One mind at a time.**
