# AI Usage Policy

## Purpose & Scope

This policy establishes ClearMinds's framework for the responsible, ethical, and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in our services. It ensures that AI is deployed in ways that enhance our wellbeing offerings whilst maintaining the highest standards of data protection, user privacy, and clinical safety.

### Our Commitment

ClearMinds is committed to using AI as a tool to empower individuals in their wellbeing journey, not to replace the human expertise and compassion that underpin our services. All AI implementations must enhance, not diminish, the quality of care and support we provide.

## 1. AI in Content Generation

### 1.1 Therapeutic Content

All therapeutic content, including hypnotherapy scripts, meditation guidance, and mindfulness exercises, is created primarily by qualified therapists and clinical professionals. AI may be used to:

- Assist in research and evidence gathering
- Suggest structural improvements to existing content
- Generate initial drafts for review by qualified professionals
- Translate content whilst maintaining therapeutic integrity

**All AI-assisted content must be reviewed, validated, and approved by qualified clinical professionals before release.**

### 1.2 Marketing & Communication

AI may be used to support marketing content creation, provided that:

- All claims remain evidence-based and compliant with ASA guidelines
- The ClearMinds tone of voice (supportive, clear, authoritative) is maintained
- UK English spelling and phrasing is used throughout
- Content is reviewed for accuracy and brand consistency

## 2. Data Protection & Privacy

### 2.1 User Data Handling

AI systems processing personal data must comply with GDPR and UK data protection legislation:

- **Data minimisation:** Only necessary data is processed by AI systems
- **Consent:** Users must be informed when AI processes their personal data
- **Anonymisation:** Personal identifiers removed wherever possible
- **Retention limits:** AI training data subject to standard retention policies
- **Right to object:** Users can opt-out of AI-driven personalisation

### 2.2 Third-Party AI Services

When using external AI services (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, other LLMs):

- Data processing agreements must be in place
- Personal data must not be shared without explicit consent
- Usage logs maintained for audit purposes
- Regular vendor assessments conducted

## 3. AI in Service Delivery

### 3.1 Personalisation & Recommendations

AI may be used to personalise user experiences and recommend appropriate content, provided that:

- Recommendations are clinically appropriate and safe
- Users can easily understand why content was recommended
- Human oversight mechanisms are in place
- Users can opt-out of AI-driven personalisation

### 3.2 Chatbots & Automated Support

AI chatbots must:

- Clearly identify themselves as automated systems
- Know their limitations and escalate appropriately
- Never provide clinical advice or diagnoses
- Include clear pathways to human support
- Be regularly reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness

### Red Line: Clinical Decisions

AI systems must never make autonomous clinical decisions, provide diagnoses, or replace qualified human judgement in therapeutic contexts. All clinical decisions require human oversight from qualified professionals.

## 4. Transparency & Disclosure

### 4.1 User Communication

Users must be clearly informed when:

- They are interacting with an AI system rather than a human
- AI has been used in creating or personalising content
- Their data may be processed by AI systems
- AI-driven recommendations are being provided

### 4.2 Partner & Corporate Transparency

Our corporate partners have a right to know:

- Which services utilise AI technology
- How AI impacts service delivery and quality
- What safeguards are in place
- How user data is processed

## 5. Quality Assurance & Safety

### 5.1 Content Quality Control

All AI-generated or AI-assisted content undergoes:

- **Clinical review:** By qualified therapists for therapeutic content
- **Accuracy check:** Fact-checking and evidence validation
