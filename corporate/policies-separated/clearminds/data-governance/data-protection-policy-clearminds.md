# Data Protection Policy - Clear Minds

**Policy Owner**: Data Protection Officer
**Effective Date**: [INSERT DATE]
**Review Date**: [ANNUAL REVIEW]
**Version**: 2.0 (Clear Minds Digital Platform)
**Applies To**: All Staff, Contractors & Partners

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

Clear Minds is committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal data in accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the Data Protection Act 2018, and all applicable data protection legislation.

### What Clear Minds Does

Clear Minds is a **digital wellness platform** offering:
- Self-directed hypnotherapy audio content
- Guided meditation and breathwork exercises
- Optional Facebook community support (moderated)

### What Clear Minds Does NOT Do

✗ We do NOT provide medical or clinical services
✗ We do NOT collect health data or medical information
✗ We do NOT process special category health data
✗ We are NOT registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)

**For clinical services**, users can be referred to our partner **Concierge Health**, a separate CQC-registered provider with its own data protection framework.

---

## 2. Scope and Application

This policy applies to:

- All personal data processed by Clear Minds
- All staff members, contractors, consultants, and temporary workers
- All data processing activities (digital platform, community, B2B services)
- All systems and platforms that process personal data
- All third parties who process personal data on our behalf

---

## 3. Data We Collect (Minimal by Design)

Clear Minds follows **data minimization** principles. We only collect what is necessary:

### 3.1 Personal Data We Collect

| Data Type | Purpose | Legal Basis |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Account personalization | Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) |
| **Email Address** | Account access, service communications | Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) |
| **Listening History** | Service delivery, content recommendations | Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) |
| **Device/Platform Metadata** | Technical support, analytics | Legitimate Interests (Art 6(1)(f)) |
| **Employer Code (B2B only)** | Access validation (not shared back) | Contract (Art 6(1)(b)) |

### 3.2 Data We DO NOT Collect

✗ Health conditions or symptoms
✗ Medical history or diagnoses
✗ Therapeutic assessments
✗ Payment card details (handled by Shopify/App Stores)
✗ National Insurance numbers, NHS numbers
✗ Precise location data

---

## 4. Data Classification

### 4.1 Listening History: Sensitive Personal Data (NOT Special Category)

**Position:** Clear Minds listening history is classified as **sensitive personal data requiring enhanced protection**, NOT special category health data under UK GDPR Article 9.

**Rationale:**
- Following industry precedent (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer, Spotify wellness content)
- Passive audio consumption without user-reported health information does not "reveal health status" under the legal definition
- Multiple non-health reasons exist for listening (curiosity, general wellness, testing for others)

**Approach:** Implement strong data protection **as if it were health data**, without the overhead of special category requirements.

**Legal Basis:**
- **Article 6(1)(b) - Contract:** Service delivery to users
- **Article 6(1)(f) - Legitimate Interests:** Service improvement, analytics

**Documentation:** See CDO Position Document (cdo_data_governance_position.md) for full reasoning and ICO accountability demonstration.

## 5. Data Protection Principles

We adhere to the seven key principles of UK GDPR:

### 5.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

- We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently
- Clear privacy notices explain what we collect and why
- Users understand their data usage before signing up

### 5.2 Purpose Limitation

- Data collected for specified, explicit, legitimate purposes only
- No processing incompatible with those purposes
- No "mission creep" - we stick to what we said

### 5.3 Data Minimisation

- **Name + email ONLY** for personal data
- Listening history for service delivery
- No unnecessary data collection

### 5.4 Accuracy

- Users can update their name and email anytime
- Listening history automatically accurate (system-generated)

## 6. Lawful Basis for Processing

### 6.1 Standard Personal Data (Name, Email, Listening History)

**Primary Basis: Contract (Article 6(1)(b))**
- Processing necessary for performance of the service contract
- Users subscribe to receive hypnotherapy audio content
- We need name/email to deliver the service

**Secondary Basis: Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f))**
- Service improvement and analytics
- Understanding which content is popular
- Not overridden by individuals' rights (low-risk data)

### 6.2 NOT Processing Special Category Data

Clear Minds does NOT process special category data (Article 9), therefore we do NOT require:
- Explicit consent for health data processing
- Article 9 conditions (health/social care, etc.)
- Appropriate Policy Document (APD)

**However:** We implement health-data-level security as best practice and competitive advantage.

### 14.2 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

- **Required?** Not legally mandatory (not special category, not large-scale systematic monitoring)
- **Recommended?** **YES** - Best practice for 70k+ users + sensitive content + B2B confidentiality requirements
- **Status:** Completed [INSERT DATE], reviewed annually

---

## 15. B2B/EAP-Specific Data Protection

### 15.1 Employee Confidentiality Architecture

**Core Principle:** **Zero Individual Visibility** to employers

**Technical Controls:**
- Employees sign up with personal email (not corporate)
- Optional employer access code for payment validation only
- Reporting dashboard enforces k≥10 anonymity threshold
- No individual-level data exports possible

**Contractual Controls:**
- Employer Non-Snooping Agreement (enforceable breach penalties)
- Prohibition on attempts to identify individuals
- Regular compliance audits

**Employers Receive:**
- Total registered users (count only)
- Overall utilization rate (%)
- Aggregated category breakdown (% using sleep, stress, confidence content)
- Demographics ONLY if ≥10 users in subgroup

**Employers NEVER Receive:**
- Individual names or identifiers
- Which employees registered
- Individual listening patterns
- Small group data (<10 users)

### 15.2 Data Sharing Agreement (Employer Contracts)

Standard clause:

> "Clear Minds Ltd processes employee data as an independent data controller. [Employer] has no access to individual employee data. Clear Minds provides [Employer] with aggregated, anonymised statistics only, subject to minimum reporting thresholds (≥10 users per subgroup) to prevent identification."
