## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Clear Minds. We are committed to protecting your privacy and personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data when you use our digital hypnotherapy platform.

**Clear Minds Ltd** is the data controller for the personal information we collect and process. We are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) under registration number: [INSERT ICO REGISTRATION NUMBER].

### What Makes Clear Minds Different

Clear Minds is a **digital wellness platform** that provides:
- Self-directed hypnotherapy audio content
- Guided meditation and breathwork exercises
- Optional Facebook community support

**We do NOT provide medical or clinical services.** For clinical support, we can refer you to our partner **Concierge Health**, a separate CQC-registered medical services provider.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly

Clear Minds collects **minimal personal information**:

- **Name:** To personalize your experience
- **Email Address:** For account access and service communications
- **Optional: Employer Code:** If accessing through workplace wellness (for access validation only, not shared back with employer)

### 2.2 Listening History (Non-Health Data)

We collect information about which hypnotherapy audio sessions you listen to:

- Which audio tracks you play
- Session duration and timestamps
- Progress tracking within the app

**Important:** Your listening history is treated as **sensitive personal data** but is NOT classified as health data. Listening to a "Better Sleep" audio suggests interest in sleep improvement, not a diagnosis of insomnia.

### 2.3 Payment Information

**Clear Minds does NOT collect or store payment information.** All payments are processed securely through:

- **Shopify** (for direct subscriptions)
- **Apple App Store** (for iOS subscriptions)
- **Google Play Store** (for Android subscriptions)

These platforms handle all payment data according to PCI-DSS standards. We never see your credit card or banking details.

### 2.4 Information We Collect Automatically

When you use our app or website, we may automatically collect:

- **Technical Information:** Device type, operating system, app version
- **Usage Information:** Features used, session duration, navigation patterns
- **Analytics Data:** Aggregated, anonymized usage statistics

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your personal information for these purposes only:

### 3.1 Providing Our Services

- Creating and managing your account
- Delivering hypnotherapy audio content to you
- Tracking your listening progress
- Sending service-related emails (password resets, updates)
- Verifying workplace wellness eligibility (if applicable)

### 3.2 Improving Our Services

- Understanding which content is popular
- Improving app performance and user experience
- Developing new features based on usage patterns
- Testing and fixing bugs

### 3.3 Workplace Wellness Reporting (B2B Only)

If you access Clear Minds through your employer:

**Your Employer Receives:**
- Total number of registered users
- Overall utilization rate (% of eligible employees)
- Aggregated content category usage (e.g., "40% of users listened to sleep content")
- Demographics **ONLY if ≥10 users** in subgroup (k-anonymity protection)

**Your Employer NEVER Receives:**
- Individual names or identifiers
- Which specific employees registered
- Individual listening history
- Any information enabling identification

**Technical Protection:** Employees sign up with personal email addresses. Employer access codes link to payment only, never to individual identity.

---

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing

Under UK GDPR, we process your personal data under these legal bases:

### 4.1 For Standard Personal Data (Name, Email, Listening History)

- **Contract (Article 6(1)(b)):** To provide the digital hypnotherapy service you've subscribed to
- **Legitimate Interests (Article 6(1)(f)):** To improve our services and analyze usage patterns

### 4.2 Why NOT Special Category Health Data?

Following industry precedent (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer), we classify listening history as sensitive personal data, NOT special category health data, because:

✅ Passive audio consumption does not "reveal health status"
✅ No user-reported symptoms or health information collected
✅ Multiple non-health reasons exist for listening (curiosity, general wellness, testing for others)
✅ Comparable to Spotify wellness playlists or YouTube meditation videos

**However, we protect your data as if it IS health data** - encryption, access controls, and privacy-first design.
