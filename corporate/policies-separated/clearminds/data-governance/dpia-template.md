# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Template

**UK GDPR Article 35 Compliance**

---

**When to Use This Template:** A DPIA is required for processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. This includes:

- New technologies or systems processing personal data
- Large-scale processing of special category data (e.g., health data)
- Systematic monitoring or profiling
- Processing that could result in discrimination or exclusion

## Assessment Details

**Project/System Name:** [Enter project or system name]

**DPIA Reference Number:** [E.g., DPIA-2024-001]

**Date Started:** [Date]

**Prepared By:** [Name and role]

**DPO Consulted:** [Yes/No - Date of consultation]

## Step 1: Identify the Need for a DPIA

### Screening Questions

Answer these questions to determine if a DPIA is required:

- [ ] Does the processing involve special category data (e.g., health data) or criminal conviction data on a large scale?
- [ ] Does the processing involve systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas on a large scale?
- [ ] Does the processing use new technologies or innovative applications?
- [ ] Does the processing involve profiling or automated decision-making with significant effects?
- [ ] Does the processing involve processing children's data on a large scale?
- [ ] Does the processing prevent data subjects from exercising their rights or accessing services?
- [ ] Does the processing combine or match datasets from different sources?
- [ ] Does the processing involve data about vulnerable data subjects?

**Outcome of Screening:** [If YES to 2+ questions, a DPIA is likely required. Document reasoning here.]

## Step 2: Describe the Processing

### 2.1 Nature of Processing

**What is the purpose of the processing?**

[Describe what you're trying to achieve and why]

**What is the nature of the processing?**

[Describe how data will be collected, used, stored, deleted]

**What is the scope of the processing?**

[How much data? How many individuals? Geographic scope? Duration?]

**What is the context of the processing?**

[Relationship with data subjects, nature of data, expectations, prior collection, sensitivity]

### 2.2 Data Categories

**What categories of personal data will be processed?**

```
[e.g.,
• Contact details (name, email, phone)
• Demographic data (age, gender, location)
• Special category data (health information, etc.)]
```

**Are you processing special category data? If yes, specify:**

[Health data, racial/ethnic origin, religious beliefs, etc.]

**What categories of data subjects are involved?**

[Employees, customers, service users, children, vulnerable individuals, etc.]

### 2.3 Legal Basis

**What is the lawful basis for processing (Article 6)?**

[Consent / Contract / Legal obligation / Vital interests / Public task / Legitimate interests]

**If processing special category data, what is the Article 9 condition?**

[Explicit consent / Health/social care / etc.]

**If relying on legitimate interests, what is the legitimate interest and have you conducted a balancing test?**

[Document legitimate interest and balancing against data subject rights]

## Step 3: Consultation Process

### 3.1 Internal Consultation

**Who has been consulted internally?**

```
[e.g.,
• Data Protection Officer - [Date]
• IT Security Team - [Date]
• Clinical Director - [Date]
• Project stakeholders - [Date]]
```

**Summary of feedback from internal consultation:**

[Key concerns, suggestions, recommendations]

### 3.2 Data Subject Consultation

**Have data subjects been consulted? If yes, how?**

[Surveys, focus groups, user testing, feedback mechanisms]

**If not, why not?**

[Justification if data subjects not consulted]

**What were the data subjects' views?**

[Summary of feedback, concerns, suggestions]

## Step 4: Assess Necessity and Proportionality

**Is the processing necessary to achieve the purpose? Could you achieve the same outcome without processing, or by processing less data?**

[Justify why processing is necessary and proportionate]

**Are you processing the minimum amount of personal data necessary?**

[Demonstrate data minimisation]

**How will you ensure data accuracy?**

[Processes for keeping data accurate and up to date]

**How long will you retain the data and why?**

[Retention periods and justification]

## Step 5: Identify and Assess Risks

**Assessing Risk:** Consider risks to individuals' rights and freedoms, not just organisational risks. Think about:

- Physical, material, or non-material damage
- Loss of control over personal data
- Discrimination or identity theft
- Financial loss or damage to reputation
- Loss of confidentiality
- Unauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation
- Economic or social disadvantage

### Risk Assessment Matrix

**Likelihood:** Low / Medium / High
**Severity:** Minimal / Significant / Severe
**Overall Risk:** Low / Medium / High

| Risk Description | Likelihood | Severity | Overall Risk | Affected Individuals |
|-----------------|------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| [e.g., Unauthorized access to sensitive health data] | [Low/Med/High] | [Min/Sig/Sev] | [Low/Med/High] | [Service users] |
| [Risk 2] | | | | |
| [Risk 3] | | | | |
| [Add more rows as needed] | | | | |

## Step 6: Identify Measures to Mitigate Risks

### Risk Mitigation Measures

For each risk identified above, document mitigation measures:

| Risk | Mitigation Measures | Responsible Person | Residual Risk | Status |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------|
| [Risk 1] | [e.g., Encryption, access controls, MFA, security monitoring] | [Name/Role] | [Low/Med/High] | [Planned/In Progress/Complete] |
| [Risk 2] | | | | |
| [Risk 3] | | | | |

### Security Measures

Specific technical and organisational measures to protect personal data:

- [ ] Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3)
- [ ] Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Role-based access controls
- [ ] Regular security audits/penetration testing
- [ ] Staff training on data protection and security
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Regular backups with secure storage
- [ ] Secure disposal procedures

**Additional security measures:**

[Document any additional measures specific to this processing]

## Step 7: Sign Off and Record Outcomes

### Outcome of DPIA

**Can the risks be mitigated to an acceptable level?**

[YES / NO - Explanation]

**Are any risks still high after mitigation?**

[If YES, you must consult the ICO before proceeding]

**Overall Conclusion:**

[APPROVED / APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS / REJECTED / REFER TO ICO]

**Conditions or recommendations (if applicable):**

[Any conditions that must be met before proceeding]

### Approvals

| Role | Name | Date | Signature/Approval |
|------|------|------|-------------------|
| **Prepared By:** | [Name] | [Date] | |
| **Data Protection Officer:** | [DPO Name] | [Date] | |
| **Approved By (Senior Management):** | [Name & Title] | [Date] | |

## Step 8: Integrate Outcomes into Project Plan

### Integration and Monitoring

**How will the DPIA outcomes be integrated into the project?**

[Document how recommendations will be implemented]

**Who is responsible for implementation?**

[Names and roles]

**What is the implementation timeline?**

[Key milestones and dates]

**How will compliance be monitored?**

[Monitoring approach and frequency]

**When will this DPIA be reviewed?**

[Review date - should be reviewed if major changes occur or at least annually]
