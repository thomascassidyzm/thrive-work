## 1. Introduction and Purpose

This Data Breach Response Plan establishes ClearMinds' procedures for identifying, assessing, responding to, and recovering from personal data breaches in compliance with UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018.

A personal data breach can have serious consequences for affected individuals and for ClearMinds. This plan ensures we respond quickly, effectively, and in compliance with legal requirements, particularly the 72-hour notification requirement to the ICO.

### 1.1 What is a Data Breach?

Under UK GDPR Article 4(12), a personal data breach means:

> "A breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed."

### 1.2 Types of Data Breaches

- **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorised or accidental disclosure of or access to personal data
- **Availability Breach:** Accidental or unauthorised loss of access to or destruction of personal data
- **Integrity Breach:** Unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data

**Examples of Data Breaches:**

- Email sent to wrong recipient containing personal data
- Loss or theft of device containing personal data
- Ransomware attack encrypting clinical records
- Unauthorised access to systems by hacker
- Staff member accessing records without authorisation
- Accidental publication of personal data on website
- Physical records left in insecure location
- Backup tapes lost or stolen

### 4.2 Immediate Actions (First Person Discovering Breach)

**Immediate Actions Checklist**

1. **STOP and CONTAIN:** Immediately stop any ongoing breach activity if safe to do so
2. **PRESERVE EVIDENCE:** Do not delete, alter, or destroy any evidence. Take screenshots if appropriate
3. **REPORT IMMEDIATELY:** Contact DPO via emergency number [NUMBER] or email dpo@clearmindseap.com
4. **DO NOT DISCUSS:** Do not discuss the breach with anyone except the DPO or response team
5. **DOCUMENT:** Write down exactly what happened, when, and what you observed
6. **SECURE AREA:** If physical breach, secure the location and prevent access

### 4.3 DPO Initial Assessment (Within 1 hour)

Upon notification, the DPO will:

1. Confirm breach details and severity
2. Activate the Data Breach Response Team
3. Assign incident reference number
4. Open incident log and begin documentation
5. Initiate immediate containment measures
6. Determine if 72-hour clock has started (when organisation became aware)
7. Notify senior management

## 5. Phase 2: Containment and Assessment (2-24 hours)

### 5.1 Immediate Containment

**IT Security Lead Actions:**

- Isolate affected systems to prevent further compromise
- Change passwords and revoke compromised credentials
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Implement firewall rules to block malicious traffic
- Preserve logs and forensic evidence
- Secure physical perimeter if physical breach

### 5.2 Breach Assessment

The response team must assess:

**Nature of the Breach**

- What type of breach occurred? (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Was it accidental or malicious?
- Is it a cyber incident, human error, or system failure?

**Scope and Impact**

- What personal data was affected?
- How many individuals are affected?
- Does it include special category data (health data)?
- Was the data encrypted or otherwise protected?
- Was the breach internal or external?
- Has the data been recovered or is it still at risk?

**Risks to Individuals**

- What are the potential consequences for affected individuals?
- Could it cause physical, material, or non-material damage?
- Could it lead to discrimination, identity theft, or fraud?
- Could it cause psychological distress or damage to reputation?
- Could it affect vulnerable individuals (children, mental health patients)?

### 5.3 Risk Severity Assessment

| Risk Level | Characteristics | ICO Report? | Data Subject Notification? |
|------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **LOW** | Minimal or no risk to individuals. Quick containment. No sensitive data. Internal breach with recovery. | NO (but log internally) | NO |
| **MEDIUM** | Some risk to individuals. Limited scope. Non-sensitive data or encrypted. Unlikely to cause significant harm. | YES (within 72 hours) | ASSESS (if risk mitigated, may not be required) |
| **HIGH** | Significant risk. Large-scale breach. Sensitive/special category data. Potential for serious harm (identity theft, discrimination, psychological harm). | YES (within 72 hours) | YES (without undue delay) |
| **CRITICAL** | Severe risk. Mass breach of health data. Children involved. High likelihood of serious harm. Media attention likely. | YES (URGENT - within 72 hours) | YES (URGENT - without undue delay) |

## 6. Phase 3: Notification and Communication (24-72 hours)

### 6.1 ICO Notification (Article 33 UK GDPR)

**When to Notify:** Within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach likely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.

**How to Notify:** Via the ICO's online breach reporting tool at https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/report-a-breach/

**Information to Include in ICO Report:**

1. **Description of the breach:** Nature of the breach, categories and approximate numbers of data subjects and records affected
2. **Contact details:** Name and contact details of the DPO or other contact point
3. **Likely consequences:** Description of the likely consequences of the breach
4. **Measures taken:** Description of measures taken or proposed to address the breach, including mitigation of possible adverse effects

**Phased Reporting:** If we cannot provide all information within 72 hours, we can submit an initial report and provide additional information in phases, explaining reasons for the delay.

### 6.2 Data Subject Notification (Article 34 UK GDPR)

**When to Notify:** Without undue delay if the breach is likely to result in a HIGH RISK to individuals' rights and freedoms.

**Exceptions (when notification NOT required):**

- Appropriate technical and organisational protection measures were applied (e.g., encryption)
- Subsequent measures taken ensure high risk is no longer likely to materialise
- Notification would involve disproportionate effort (can use public communication instead)

**Content of Data Subject Notifications:**

- **Clear and Plain Language:** Easy to understand, avoid technical jargon
- **Nature of Breach:** Describe what happened in simple terms
- **Contact Point:** DPO contact details for questions
- **Likely Consequences:** What could happen as a result of the breach
- **Measures Taken:** What we've done to address the breach
- **Recommended Actions:** What individuals should do to protect themselves
- **Support Offered:** Any support we're providing (e.g., credit monitoring)

**Notification Methods:**

- **Preferred:** Direct communication (email, letter, phone call)
- **Alternative:** Public announcement if direct communication impossible or disproportionate
- **Multiple Channels:** Use several methods to ensure affected individuals are reached

### 6.3 Internal Communication

- **Staff:** Brief affected staff; provide talking points; emphasise confidentiality
- **Board/Senior Management:** Regular updates on incident status
- **Department Updates:** Keep all relevant departments informed

### 6.4 External Communication

- Review processor relationship and contract

### 10.2 Ransomware Attacks

Ransomware is both an availability breach and often a confidentiality breach:

- **DO NOT PAY RANSOM** without explicit authorisation from CEO and DPO
- Assume data has been exfiltrated unless proven otherwise
- Engage cybersecurity forensics immediately
- Report to National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Action Fraud
- Notify ICO within 72 hours
- Consider if data subjects need notification (usually yes for health data)

### 10.3 Insider Threats

Breaches caused by malicious or negligent insiders:

- Immediately revoke all system access
- Preserve evidence (do not alert the individual initially)
- Engage HR and consider police involvement
- Review access logs to determine full extent
- Consider injunction to prevent further disclosure
- Disciplinary and potentially legal action

### 10.4 Physical Breaches

Loss or theft of devices or physical records:

- Report to police immediately (obtain crime reference number)
