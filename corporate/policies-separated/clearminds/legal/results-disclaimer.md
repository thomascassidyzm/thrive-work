## Important Notice: Individual Results May Vary

**ClearMinds makes no guarantees regarding the results you may or may not achieve through using our hypnotherapy services.** Outcomes depend on numerous individual factors and vary significantly from person to person.

---

## 1. No Guaranteed Outcomes

### 1.1 What We Do NOT Guarantee

ClearMinds does **not** guarantee, promise, or warrant:

- **Specific results** – Such as reduced stress, improved sleep, weight loss, smoking cessation, or any other specific outcome
- **Timeframes for results** – How quickly (if at all) you may notice benefits
- **Permanent changes** – The durability or longevity of any benefits experienced
- **Universal effectiveness** – That our services will work for everyone
- **Medical outcomes** – Improvement in any medical or mental health condition
- **Professional advancement** – Improved work performance, career success, or business outcomes
- **Relationship improvements** – Enhanced personal or professional relationships
- **Financial gains** – Increased income, productivity, or economic benefit

---

## 2. How Hypnotherapy Differs from Meditation Apps

### 2.1 Permanent Pattern Change vs. Symptom Management

ClearMinds uses hypnotherapy, which differs fundamentally from meditation apps (such as Calm or Headspace):

**Meditation Apps** focus on **symptom management**:
- Require daily practice to maintain benefits
- Mask stress/anxiety temporarily
- Effects diminish if you stop practicing
- Habit formation approach
- Ongoing commitment needed indefinitely

**ClearMinds Hypnotherapy** targets **root causes**:
- Direct reprogramming of neural pathways at the subconscious level
- Addresses underlying belief systems and thought patterns
- Typical engagement: 6-18 hours of focused practice for pattern change
- Effects strengthen over time without daily practice required
- Aims for permanent pattern change, not temporary relief

### 2.2 Important Clarification

**This does NOT mean "guaranteed cure" or "immediate results."** Individual results vary significantly based on:
- Personal commitment and consistency of use
- Individual hypnotic susceptibility (see Section 3.1)
- Specific issue being addressed
- Current life circumstances and stress levels
- Concurrent support (therapy, medical treatment, lifestyle changes)

**The mechanism is fundamentally different** (resolution vs. management), but outcomes depend on many individual factors and cannot be guaranteed.

---

## 3. Factors Affecting Results

### 3.1 Individual Differences

Your results from using ClearMinds may be influenced by many individual factors, including but not limited to:

- **Personal commitment and consistency** – How regularly and consistently you use the services
- **Individual responsiveness to hypnotherapy** – Some people are more responsive to hypnotic suggestion than others
- **Current mental and physical health status** – Underlying health conditions may affect outcomes
- **Life circumstances** – Stress levels, life events, social support, and environmental factors
- **Expectations and beliefs** – Your mindset and openness to the process
- **Concurrent treatments or interventions** – Other therapies, medications, or lifestyle changes
- **Age, health history, and genetics** – Biological and developmental factors
- **Motivation and goals** – Clarity of purpose and personal drive

### 3.2 Hypnotic Susceptibility

**Important:** Research shows that individuals vary widely in their responsiveness to hypnotic suggestion. Approximately **10-15% of people are highly susceptible** to hypnosis, while **10-15% show minimal response**. Most people fall somewhere in between. Your individual level of hypnotic susceptibility will significantly affect your experience and outcomes.

## 4. Testimonials and Case Studies

### 4.1 User Testimonials

Any testimonials, reviews, or user experiences shared by ClearMinds:

- **Represent individual experiences only** – They are not representative of all users
- **Are not guarantees of similar results** – Your experience may be completely different
- **May use pseudonyms** – To protect user privacy (as stated in Terms of Service)
- **May not reflect typical outcomes** – Positive testimonials may represent best-case scenarios
- **Are provided voluntarily** – Users may have been motivated to share particularly positive experiences

### 4.2 Statistics and Research

Any statistics, research findings, or data referenced by ClearMinds:

- **Relate to general hypnotherapy research** – Not necessarily to ClearMinds specifically
- **Reflect average or aggregate data** – Individual outcomes vary widely around averages
- **May not apply to your situation** – Research participants may differ from you in significant ways
- **Are subject to study limitations** – All research has methodological constraints and context-specific findings

**Past performance is not indicative of future results.** The fact that other users have reported benefits does not mean you will experience similar outcomes.

---

## 5. Required Effort and Commitment

### 5.1 Active Participation Required

Hypnotherapy is **not a passive process**. Results, if achieved, typically require:

- **Regular, consistent use** – Daily or frequent practice over weeks or months
- **Active engagement** – Full attention and participation during sessions
- **Openness and willingness** – A receptive mindset and genuine desire for change
- **Integration of learnings** – Applying insights and techniques in daily life
- **Patience and persistence** – Allowing time for gradual changes to occur
- **Self-reflection and awareness** – Monitoring your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviours

### 5.2 No "Quick Fix"

**ClearMinds is not a "quick fix" or "miracle cure."** While some users may notice benefits relatively quickly, lasting change typically requires sustained effort, practice, and personal commitment over an extended period.

---

## 6. Workplace Wellness Context

### 6.1 Employer-Provided Access

If you are accessing ClearMinds through your employer as a workplace wellness benefit:

- **No guarantee of workplace outcomes** – Such as reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, or better job performance
- **Individual results only** – Aggregate data provided to employers shows anonymised trends, not individual outcomes
- **Not a substitute for workplace support** – ClearMinds does not replace occupational health services, HR support, or professional development
- **Voluntary participation** – Using ClearMinds is your choice; results depend on your personal engagement

### 6.2 Organisational Benefits Claims

Any claims made to employers about organisational benefits (e.g., reduced stress-related absence, improved employee wellbeing) are based on:

- **Aggregate, anonymised data** – Not individual employee outcomes
- **Self-reported measures** – User feedback and engagement metrics
- **General research on hypnotherapy** – Not controlled studies of ClearMinds specifically
- **Correlational data** – Not definitive proof of causation

---

## 7. No Medical or Clinical Claims

### 7.1 Wellness, Not Treatment

ClearMinds is a **wellness and personal development platform**, not a medical or therapeutic treatment service:

- **We do not claim to treat, cure, or diagnose** any medical or mental health condition
- **Hypnotherapy is complementary** – It may support general wellbeing but is not a replacement for professional medical care
- **No clinical outcomes guaranteed** – Such as remission of symptoms, reduced medication use, or medical improvement
- **Always consult healthcare professionals** – For medical or mental health concerns (see Medical Disclaimer)

---

## 8. Changes Over Time

### 8.1 Non-Linear Progress

If you do experience benefits from ClearMinds, progress may be:

- **Non-linear** – With ups and downs, not steady improvement
- **Gradual and subtle** – Small changes over time rather than dramatic shifts
- **Temporary or fluctuating** – Benefits may come and go or require ongoing practice to maintain
- **Context-dependent** – More noticeable in some situations than others

### 8.2 Maintenance and Continuation

**Any benefits you experience may diminish or disappear if you stop using ClearMinds.** Like physical exercise, the benefits of hypnotherapy and meditation often require ongoing practice to maintain.

---

## 9. Third-Party Services

### 9.1 Partner Referrals

ClearMinds may provide information about or referrals to third-party services (therapists, coaches, medical professionals):

- **No guarantee of third-party results** – We are not responsible for outcomes from third-party services
- **Informational purposes only** – Referrals are suggestions, not endorsements or guarantees
- **Independent relationships** – Any engagement with third parties is your responsibility

---

## 10. Refund Policy

### 10.1 No Results-Based Refunds

Because results are highly individual and cannot be guaranteed:

- **Refunds are not provided based on lack of results** – See our Terms of Service for our refund policy
- **Satisfaction is subjective** – We provide access to services, not guaranteed outcomes
- **Fair usage applies** – Our refund policy (if applicable) is based on service delivery, not individual outcomes

---

## 11. Limitation of Liability

**To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClearMinds and its directors, officers, employees, and affiliates shall not be liable for:**

- Failure to achieve desired results or outcomes
- Time, effort, or resources invested without achieving results
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use or inability to achieve results
- Decisions made or actions taken based on expected outcomes that did not materialise
- Any financial, professional, personal, or other losses related to using our services

**See our Terms of Service for full limitation of liability details.**

---

## 12. Managing Expectations

### 12.1 Realistic Expectations

To make the most of ClearMinds, we recommend:

- **Approach with curiosity, not expectation** – Be open to whatever your experience may be
- **Focus on the process, not outcomes** – Engage fully with each session without attachment to specific results
- **Be patient with yourself** – Change, if it occurs, often happens gradually
- **Combine with other healthy practices** – Hypnotherapy works best as part of a holistic approach to wellbeing
- **Seek professional support when needed** – If you're struggling, consult qualified professionals (see Medical Disclaimer)
