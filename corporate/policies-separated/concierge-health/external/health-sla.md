# Health Service Level Agreement

## 1. Executive Summary

This Health Service Level Agreement (SLA) defines the service standards, performance metrics, and commitments that ClearMinds provides to its corporate partners and their employees. It ensures transparency, accountability, and consistent quality in the delivery of our mental health and wellbeing services.

### Our Service Promise

ClearMinds commits to providing accessible, evidence-based mental health support that empowers individuals to take control of their wellbeing. This SLA formalises our commitment to service excellence, rapid response times, and measurable outcomes.
