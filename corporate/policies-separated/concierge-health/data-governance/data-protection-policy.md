As a provider of workplace mental health and wellness support services, we process sensitive personal data, including special category data relating to health. We recognise the critical importance of maintaining the highest standards of data protection and privacy.

This policy sets out our approach to data protection and the responsibilities of all staff, contractors, and partners who process personal data on behalf of ClearMinds.

- All personal data processed by ClearMinds
- All staff members, contractors, consultants, and temporary workers
- All data processing activities, whether manual or automated
- All systems, platforms, and technologies that process personal data
- All third parties who process personal data on our behalf

## 3. Definitions

## 4. Data Protection Principles

We adhere to the seven key principles of data protection:

### 4.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We provide clear information about how we use personal data through privacy notices and ensure individuals understand what data we collect and why.

### 4.2 Purpose Limitation

We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes only. We do not process data in ways incompatible with those purposes without obtaining fresh consent or having another lawful basis.

### 4.3 Data Minimisation

We only collect and process personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.

### 4.4 Accuracy

We take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate data is rectified or deleted without delay.

### 4.5 Storage Limitation

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, in line with our Data Retention Policy.

### 4.6 Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

### 4.7 Accountability

We demonstrate compliance with these principles through documentation, policies, procedures, training, and regular audits.

## 5. Lawful Basis for Processing

We only process personal data where we have a lawful basis under Article 6 of UK GDPR:

### 5.1 Standard Personal Data

- **Consent:** The individual has given clear consent for us to process their data
- **Contract:** Processing is necessary for performance of a contract with the individual
- **Legal obligation:** Processing is necessary to comply with the law
- **Vital interests:** Processing is necessary to protect someone's life
- **Public task:** Processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest
- **Legitimate interests:** Processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (unless overridden by individual's rights)

### 5.2 Special Category Data (Health Data)

For health data, we also require a condition under Article 9 UK GDPR:

- **Explicit consent:** The individual has given explicit consent (e.g., accepting terms when booking counselling)
- **Health/social care purposes:** Processing is necessary for health or social care purposes (Article 9(2)(h))
- **Public health:** Processing in the public interest in public health

**Special Category Data Handling:** Health data requires additional safeguards. All staff must complete specialist training on handling health data and follow strict confidentiality procedures.

## 6. Data Subject Rights

Individuals have the following rights under UK GDPR:

### 6.1 Right to be Informed

Individuals have the right to know how their personal data is being used. We provide this information through our Privacy Policy and privacy notices.

Individuals have the right to obtain a copy of their personal data and information about how it is processed. We respond to Subject Access Requests (SARs) within one month. See our SAR Procedure for details.

### 6.3 Right to Rectification

Individuals can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data. We update records promptly upon receiving such requests.

### 6.4 Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten')

In certain circumstances, individuals can request deletion of their personal data. This right is not absolute - we may need to retain data for legal or regulatory reasons.

### 6.5 Right to Restrict Processing

Individuals can request that we limit how we use their data in certain circumstances (e.g., while accuracy is verified).

### 6.6 Right to Data Portability

Individuals can request their data in a structured, commonly used format to transfer to another service provider.

### 6.7 Right to Object

Individuals can object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes.

Individuals have rights regarding automated decisions (including profiling) that have legal or significant effects. We do not currently use fully automated decision-making.

**Exercising Rights**
