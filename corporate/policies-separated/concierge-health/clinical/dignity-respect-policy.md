We are committed to valuing diversity, promoting equality, and creating an inclusive environment where everyone is treated as a unique individual with inherent worth.

- Challenge discrimination, harassment, and disrespectful behaviour
- Empower service users to be active participants in their care

## 3. What Does Dignity Mean?

### 3.1 Defining Dignity

Dignity means recognising and respecting the inherent worth and value of every person. In the context of ClearMinds services, dignity includes:

- **Being treated as an individual** – Recognised for who you are, not reduced to a condition, diagnosis, or problem
- **Having control and choice** – Empowered to make decisions about your care and treatment
- **Privacy and confidentiality** – Personal information protected; private space respected
- **Being heard and valued** – Opinions, preferences, and concerns listened to and taken seriously
- **Feeling safe and respected** – Free from discrimination, harassment, or degrading treatment
- **Maintaining independence** – Supported to do things for yourself where possible
- **Being treated with compassion** – Kindness, empathy, and understanding

### 3.2 What Undermines Dignity?

Dignity can be undermined by:

- Making assumptions about people based on stereotypes
- Ignoring or dismissing people's views and preferences
- Using labels or language that dehumanises or stigmatises
- Breaching confidentiality or discussing people inappropriately
- Discrimination, bias, or prejudice
- Rushed, impersonal, or transactional interactions
- Overriding people's choices without justification
- Disrespectful tone, body language, or communication

## 4. Person-Centred Care

### The Four Principles of Person-Centred Care

1. **Individuality**: Recognise each person as unique with their own history, identity, values, and goals
2. **Rights**: Uphold people's human rights and support them to exercise their rights
3. **Choice**: Offer options, respect decisions, and empower people to have control over their care
4. **Partnership**: Work collaboratively with service users as equal partners in the therapeutic process

### 4.1 Person-Centred Care in Practice

At ClearMinds, person-centred care means:

| Aspect | What This Looks Like |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Assessment** | Collaborative exploration of service user's concerns, goals, and preferences. Service user is expert on their own experience. |
| **Care planning** | Goals and interventions co-created with service user, not imposed by therapist. Flexible and responsive to changing needs. |
| **Communication** | Clear, jargon-free language. Active listening. Checking understanding. Respecting communication preferences. |
| **Therapeutic relationship** | Built on trust, empathy, and genuine regard. Non-judgmental acceptance. Power imbalance minimised. |
| **Pace and timing** | Therapy progresses at service user's pace. No pressure to disclose or move faster than comfortable. |
| **Review and feedback** | Regular check-ins on whether therapy is meeting service user's needs. Willingness to adjust approach. |

## 5. Privacy and Confidentiality

### 5.1 Confidentiality is Central to Dignity

Respecting privacy and maintaining confidentiality are fundamental to dignified care. Service users must feel confident that:

- Personal information will be kept confidential
- They can speak openly without fear of information being shared inappropriately
- They will be informed about limits to confidentiality (safeguarding, risk)
- Their consent will be sought before sharing information with third parties

### 5.2 Privacy in Virtual/Remote Sessions

For remote therapy delivery, ClearMinds ensures:

- **Secure platform**: Video and telephone sessions conducted on encrypted, GDPR-compliant platforms
- **Private space**: Therapists work from private, confidential spaces (not open-plan offices or public areas)
- **Service user privacy**: Encourage service users to find private space for sessions; offer telephone option if privacy difficult
- **Screen privacy**: Therapists ensure screens not visible to others; no recording without explicit consent
- **Data protection**: Clinical notes stored securely; access restricted to authorised personnel

### 5.3 Discussing Service Users Respectfully

When discussing service users in supervision, case consultations, or handovers:

- Use professional, respectful language
- Avoid gossip, judgment, or inappropriate humour
- Only share information on a need-to-know basis
- Anonymise where appropriate (e.g., academic discussions)
- Consider: "Would I be comfortable if the service user heard this conversation?"

## 6. Respecting Diversity and Promoting Equality

### 6.1 The Equality Act 2010 – Protected Characteristics

ClearMinds is committed to equality and non-discrimination. We must not discriminate against anyone based on protected characteristics:

#### Protected Characteristics

- **Age** – Treating people fairly regardless of age
- **Disability** – Physical, sensory, mental health conditions, learning disabilities
- **Gender reassignment** – Transgender and non-binary individuals
- **Marriage and civil partnership**
- **Pregnancy and maternity**
- **Race** – Ethnicity, nationality, skin colour
- **Religion or belief** – Including lack of religion
- **Sex** – Male, female, intersex
- **Sexual orientation** – Lesbian, gay, bisexual, heterosexual, asexual, etc.

### 6.2 Positive Duty to Advance Equality

Beyond non-discrimination, ClearMinds actively promotes equality by:

- Removing barriers to accessing our services
- Providing reasonable adjustments for disabled service users
- Offering diverse and culturally sensitive therapeutic approaches
- Recruiting diverse workforce and providing equality training
- Monitoring equality data to identify and address disparities
- Celebrating diversity and fostering inclusive culture

## 7. Cultural, Religious, and Individual Needs

### 7.1 Cultural Competence

Therapists must demonstrate cultural competence – the ability to work effectively with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. This means:

- **Self-awareness**: Recognise your own cultural background, biases, and assumptions
- **Cultural knowledge**: Learn about different cultures, beliefs, and worldviews
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Approach differences with curiosity, respect, and humility
- **Adaptability**: Tailor therapeutic approach to fit service user's cultural context
- **Avoid stereotyping**: Don't assume all members of a cultural group are the same

### 7.2 Religious and Spiritual Needs

ClearMinds respects service users' religious and spiritual beliefs, including:

- Acknowledging the role of faith in wellbeing and coping
- Not imposing therapist's own beliefs or challenging service user's faith
- Exploring how religious/spiritual practices can support mental health
- Being sensitive to religious observances (prayer times, fasting, holy days)
- Signposting to faith-based support if appropriate

### 7.3 Dietary, Lifestyle, and Personal Preferences

While ClearMinds primarily provides talking therapy (not physical care), we respect:

- Dietary requirements and preferences (if offering refreshments at face-to-face sessions)
- Gender preferences (e.g., service user preferring male or female therapist)
- Language needs (interpretation or translation services if required)
- Communication preferences (video, phone, face-to-face)
- Modesty and personal boundaries

## 8. Empowerment and Choice

### 8.1 Supporting Service Users to Make Choices

Empowerment means supporting service users to have control over their care. ClearMinds promotes choice by:

- **Offering options**: Choice of therapist (where possible), therapeutic approach, session format
- **Sharing information**: Clear, accessible information about services, interventions, and what to expect
- **Collaborative goal-setting**: Service user defines their own goals and success criteria
- **Respecting decisions**: Even if therapist would choose differently (provided no risk)
- **Right to decline**: Service users can decline interventions, pause therapy, or end treatment
- **Self-advocacy**: Encourage service users to voice concerns, ask questions, and challenge if unhappy

### 8.2 Balancing Empowerment with Protection

Empowerment must be balanced with safeguarding responsibilities:

- If service user's choices place them or others at significant risk, duty of care applies
- Mental capacity considerations (see Consent and Capacity Policy)
- Professional judgment and ethical obligations
- Transparency: explain why certain actions necessary even if service user disagrees

## 9. Communication and Language

### 9.1 Respectful Communication Principles

#### Communicating with Dignity

- **Use preferred names and pronouns**: Ask how service user would like to be addressed; respect chosen name and pronouns
- **Avoid jargon**: Use clear, plain language; explain any technical or clinical terms
- **Active listening**: Give full attention; don't interrupt; demonstrate you've heard and understood
- **Empathy and warmth**: Communicate with genuine care and compassion
- **Non-verbal communication**: Be aware of tone, facial expressions, body language (including in video sessions)
- **Patience**: Allow time for people to express themselves; don't rush
- **Check understanding**: Confirm service user has understood; invite questions

### 9.2 Person-First and Identity-First Language

ClearMinds respects service users' preferences regarding identity language:

- **Person-first**: "Person with depression" (emphasises personhood, not condition)
- **Identity-first**: "Autistic person" (some people prefer this, particularly in neurodivergent community)
- **Best practice**: Ask the individual their preference, or follow their lead

### 9.3 Avoiding Stigmatising Language

Language matters. Avoid stigmatising or disrespectful terms:

| Don't Say | Do Say |
|-----------|--------|
| "Suffers from mental illness" | "Experiences mental health difficulties" or "living with [condition]" |
| "Crazy", "insane", "psycho" | Avoid casual use of mental health terms as insults or exaggerations |
| "Committed suicide" | "Died by suicide" (avoid criminalising language) |
| "The depressed person", "the schizophrenic" | "Person with depression", "person with schizophrenia" |
| "Wheelchair-bound", "confined to a wheelchair" | "Wheelchair user" (wheelchair provides mobility, not confinement) |
| "Transgender person" (as a noun) | "Transgender person" or "trans person" (adjective, not noun) |

### 9.4 Accessible Communication

ClearMinds provides accessible communication for service users with:

- **Hearing impairment**: British Sign Language (BSL) interpretation, subtitles/captions for video, written communication options
- **Visual impairment**: Screen readers, large print, verbal descriptions
- **Learning disability/cognitive impairment**: Easy Read formats, simple language, visual aids, extra time
- **Language barriers**: Interpretation and translation services
- **Neurodivergence**: Clear structure, written agendas, minimise sensory distractions

## 10. Treating People as Individuals

### 10.1 Getting to Know the Person

Person-centred care requires understanding the individual beyond their presenting problem:

- What matters to them? (Values, goals, aspirations)
- What is their background and life story?
- What are their strengths and resources?
- What are their preferences and dislikes?
- What makes them unique?

### 10.2 Avoiding Assumptions and Stereotypes

Be aware of implicit biases and assumptions based on:

- Appearance, age, accent, or background
- Diagnosis or condition
- Cultural or religious background
- Gender, sexuality, or relationship status
- Socioeconomic status or occupation

**Practice curiosity, not assumption**: Ask, listen, and learn about each person's unique experience.

### 10.3 Strengths-Based Approach

Focus on what service users can do, not just their problems:

- Identify and build on existing strengths and coping strategies
- Recognise resilience and achievements
- Avoid deficit-focused language ("can't", "won't", "non-compliant")
- Empower through recognising competence and capability

## 11. Dignity in Challenging Situations

### 11.1 When Service Users Are Distressed

Maintain dignity when service users are upset, angry, or in crisis:

- Remain calm, compassionate, and non-judgmental
- Offer reassurance and containment
- Respect need for space if appropriate
- Avoid patronising or dismissive responses ("calm down", "it's not that bad")
- Validate feelings while maintaining boundaries
- Discuss the situation sensitively after immediate crisis passes

### 11.2 Maintaining Dignity in Risk Situations

When safeguarding concerns or risk issues arise:

- Be honest and transparent about actions you must take
- Explain why and involve service user as much as possible
- Maintain respect and empathy even when overriding wishes
- Document actions with dignity (avoid judgmental language in records)

### 11.3 Ending Therapeutic Relationships Respectfully

Whether therapy ends as planned or prematurely, ensure dignified closure:

- Offer planned ending with time to reflect and consolidate learning
- Acknowledge service user's efforts and progress
- Provide signposting and resources for ongoing support
- If service user disengages, offer opportunity to return or end formally
- Avoid abandonment (sudden, unexplained endings)
