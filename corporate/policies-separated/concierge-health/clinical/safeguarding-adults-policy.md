## 1. Policy Statement

ClearMinds is committed to safeguarding all adults who access our services from abuse, neglect, and improper treatment. We recognize that some service users may be experiencing vulnerability due to mental health challenges, workplace stress, or personal circumstances.

Safeguarding means protecting an adult's right to live in safety, free from abuse and neglect. Under the **Care Act 2014**, safeguarding duties apply to adults who:

- Have needs for care and support (whether or not the local authority is meeting any of those needs)
- Are experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect
- As a result of those care and support needs, are unable to protect themselves

### 2.2 Six Principles of Safeguarding (Care Act 2014)

| Principle | What This Means |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Empowerment** | People supported and encouraged to make their own decisions and give informed consent |
| **Prevention** | It is better to take action before harm occurs |
| **Proportionality** | Proportionate and least intrusive response appropriate to the risk |
| **Protection** | Support and representation for those in greatest need |
| **Partnership** | Local solutions through services working together |
| **Accountability** | Accountability and transparency in delivering safeguarding |

### Step 2: Record

- Record date, time, location, who was present
- Note any visible injuries or signs of distress (do NOT examine or photograph)
- Distinguish between fact, opinion, and hearsay

## 7. Designated Safeguarding Lead Actions

Upon receiving a concern, the DSL will:

### 7.1 Immediate Assessment (Same Day)

- Evaluate the level of risk and urgency
- Ensure the person is currently safe
- Decide whether to make an immediate referral to statutory services
- Consider whether police involvement is required

### 7.2 Making a Safeguarding Referral

If the three-part test is met (adult with care/support needs + experiencing abuse + unable to protect self), the DSL will refer to:

**Local Authority Safeguarding Adults Team**
Contact details vary by service user's local authority area. DSL maintains current contact list.

**Referral methods:**

- Online referral form (most local authorities)
- Phone referral to Adult Social Care duty team
- Email to safeguarding team (confirm receipt)

**Information to include:**

- Adult's details (name, DOB, address, contact info)
- Nature of concern and type of abuse suspected
- Consent status (has the adult consented to the referral?)
- Current risk and safety status
- Details of alleged perpetrator (if known)
- Any immediate action taken
- Contact details for referrer (DSL)

### 7.3 When to Involve Police

Contact police immediately if:

- A criminal offence may have been committed
- There is immediate risk to life or serious injury
- Evidence needs to be preserved (e.g., scene of crime)
- The person is unable to report themselves and requests help

### 7.4 Record Keeping

- All safeguarding records stored securely and separately from clinical notes
- Access restricted to DSL, Deputy DSL, and senior management
- Retained for 7 years minimum (or longer if ongoing case)
- Compliant with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018

## 8. Consent and Information Sharing

### 8.1 General Rule: Seek Consent

Wherever possible, obtain the adult's consent before sharing information with safeguarding agencies. Explain:

- Why you are concerned
- What information you need to share
- Who you need to share it with
- What is likely to happen as a result

### 8.2 Sharing Without Consent

#### When Consent Can Be Overridden

Information may be shared **without consent** when:

- The person lacks mental capacity to consent (Mental Capacity Act 2005) and sharing is in their best interests
- There is a risk to others (e.g., children or other vulnerable adults)
- A serious crime has been or may be committed
- There is an overriding public interest
- There is a court order or statutory duty to share

Document the decision-making process and reasons for overriding consent.

### 8.3 Information Sharing Principles

- Share on a need-to-know basis only
- Share the minimum information necessary
- Distinguish between fact and opinion
- Ensure information is accurate and up-to-date
- Record what was shared, with whom, when, and why

## 9. Mental Capacity and Safeguarding

Under the **Mental Capacity Act 2005**, we must assume an adult has capacity unless proven otherwise.

### 9.1 Five Principles of Mental Capacity Act

1. Presumption of capacity
2. Support to make decisions
3. Right to make unwise decisions
4. Best interests (if lacks capacity)
5. Least restrictive option

### 9.2 Capacity Assessment

An adult lacks capacity if they cannot:

- **Understand** the information relevant to the decision
- **Retain** that information
- **Use or weigh** the information as part of decision-making
- **Communicate** their decision

**Note**: Capacity is decision-specific and time-specific. A person may lack capacity for complex financial decisions but have capacity to decide about personal care.

### 9.3 Best Interests Decisions

If an adult lacks capacity, decisions must be made in their best interests, considering:

- The person's past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs, and values
- Views of family, carers, and others with an interest
- Whether capacity might be regained
- The least restrictive option

## 10. Allegations Against Staff or Volunteers

If a service user, colleague, or external party alleges that a ClearMinds staff member or therapist has:

- Behaved in a way that has harmed, or may have harmed, a service user
- Committed a criminal offence
- Behaved in a way that indicates unsuitability to work with vulnerable adults

**Immediate actions:**

- Report immediately to Clinical Director or Managing Director (not the DSL if they are implicated)
- Consider suspension pending investigation (not an assumption of guilt)
- Refer to Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) if required by local procedures
- Notify CQC within required timeframes (serious incident notification)
- Cooperate fully with police investigations
- Consider referral to professional regulatory bodies (NCH, BACP, UKCP)
- Review and learn from the incident to prevent recurrence

## 11. Safeguarding Training

All staff receive safeguarding training appropriate to their role:

| Staff Group | Training Level | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| All staff (clinical and non-clinical) | Safeguarding Adults Level 1 & 2 | Induction + annual refresh |
| Therapists and clinical staff | Safeguarding Adults Level 3 | Every 3 years |
| Designated Safeguarding Lead | Safeguarding Adults Level 4 (Strategic) | Every 3 years |
| All staff | Mental Capacity Act & DoLS awareness | Induction + every 3 years |

Training records maintained by HR and reviewed during supervision and appraisals.

## 12. Safer Recruitment

To prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable adults, ClearMinds follows robust recruitment procedures:

- Enhanced DBS checks for all clinical staff and roles with service user contact
- DBS checks renewed every 3 years
- Right to work checks and verification of qualifications
- Two professional references (one from most recent employer)
- Gaps in employment history explored during interview
- Registration with professional bodies verified (NCH, BACP, UKCP)
- Safeguarding questions during interview process

## 13. Confidentiality vs. Safeguarding

While we respect client confidentiality, safeguarding concerns **override confidentiality** in certain circumstances.

### Our Approach to Confidentiality

**What we tell clients at the start of therapy:**

"Everything you tell me is confidential, except in three situations where I have a legal or ethical duty to share information:

1. If I'm concerned about your immediate safety or someone else's safety
2. If you disclose abuse or harm involving a child or vulnerable adult
3. If I'm required by law to disclose (e.g., court order, terrorism concerns)

If any of these situations arise, I'll talk to you about what I need to do, unless doing so would increase risk."

## 14. Reporting to CQC

ClearMinds must notify CQC **without delay** of certain safeguarding incidents:

### Notifiable Safeguarding Incidents (Regulation 18)

- Abuse or allegations of abuse by staff, service users, or others
- Incidents reported to or investigated by police
- Safeguarding referrals made to local authorities
- Serious injury or harm to service users
- Deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) applications

**How to notify CQC**: Online notification via CQC portal within timeframes specified in Regulation 18.

## 15. Multi-Agency Working

Effective safeguarding requires collaboration with:

- **Local Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs)**: Strategic partnerships coordinating safeguarding
- **Adult Social Care**: Assessment and safeguarding investigations (Section 42 enquiries)
- **Police**: Criminal investigations and immediate protection
- **NHS services**: GPs, mental health teams, hospitals
- **Housing providers**: Especially for domestic abuse and homelessness
- **Employers**: If abuse is workplace-related
- **Advocacy services**: Independent support for service users

## 16. Safeguarding Culture at ClearMinds

We are committed to creating an organizational culture where:

- Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility
- Staff feel confident to raise concerns without fear of reprisal
- Service users are empowered and their voices heard
- Continuous learning from incidents and near misses
- Regular supervision includes safeguarding reflection
- Policies are accessible, understood, and followed

## 17. Policy Review and Monitoring

This policy is reviewed:

- Annually as a minimum
- Following serious safeguarding incidents
- When legislation or guidance changes
- After CQC inspections or safeguarding audits

The Clinical Governance Committee monitors:

- Number and types of safeguarding concerns raised
- Referrals made to statutory agencies
- Staff training compliance rates
- Learning from safeguarding incidents
- CQC notifications and outcomes

### Remember: Safeguarding is Everyone's Responsibility

If you see something that concerns you, say something. It is better to report a concern that turns out to be nothing than to stay silent and allow harm to continue.

**When in doubt, always consult the Designated Safeguarding Lead.**
