# EMPLOYEE PRIVACY NOTICE
## Your Mental Health Support is Confidential

**For Employees of:** [Your Company Name]
**Mental Health Partner:** ClearMinds
**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Document Type:** Employee-Facing Privacy Information

---

## Quick Answer: What Can Your Employer See?

### ‚ùå YOUR EMPLOYER **CANNOT** SEE:
- **Who is using ClearMinds** - They don't know if you're participating or not
- **What you share** - No access to your posts, messages, or conversations
- **Your assessment results** - Your Neuroindicator scores, AI coaching topics, or mental health pathways
- **Community activity** - Whether you joined the peer support group, what you posted, or who you talked to
- **Individual usage data** - How often you use the app, which features you access, or what content you view

### ‚úÖ YOUR EMPLOYER **CAN** SEE:
- **Aggregated statistics only** (groups of 10+ employees):
  - "35% of employees are using the service"
  - "Most common pathways: stress management, sleep issues"
  - "Engagement increased 15% this quarter"
- **No individual-level detail** - Your personal information is never shared

### üîí BOTTOM LINE:
**Your employer pays for the service as an employee benefit, but they cannot see who uses it or what you share. Your participation is completely confidential.**

---

## How ClearMinds Protects Your Privacy

### 1. **Strict Confidentiality Agreement**
Your employer has signed a legally binding agreement that:
- **Prohibits** them from monitoring, tracking, or identifying who uses ClearMinds
- **Prohibits** them from accessing community posts or individual data
- **Prohibits** them from taking any adverse action against you for using mental health support
- **Requires** immediate notification to ClearMinds if they accidentally learn of your participation
- **Penalties** include contract termination and legal liability if they violate these rules

### 2. **Technical Safeguards**
- **Separate data systems**: Your employer accesses a completely different portal that shows only anonymized aggregate data
- **k‚â•10 anonymization**: Individual data is NEVER shared unless the group contains at least 10 employees (and even then, no names)
- **Encryption**: All your data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access controls**: ClearMinds staff are trained on privacy protocols and access is strictly limited
- **Audit logs**: We monitor for any unauthorized access attempts

### 3. **Professional Moderation**
- **24/7 community moderation** by trained professionals (not your employer)
- **Crisis support** connects you to independent helplines, not your workplace
- **Employer-blocking**: We actively detect and block any attempts by employers to join communities

## How We Share (and Don't Share) Your Data

### ‚úÖ Shared WITH Your Employer (Anonymized Only):
**Aggregate statistics** showing overall program impact:

- **Example**: "Average engagement: 8 sessions per active user" (no individual detail)

**Threshold**: Data is only shared when groups contain ‚â•10 employees. If fewer than 10 employees accessed a specific pathway, we report "fewer than 10" instead of the exact number.

### ‚ùå NEVER Shared With Your Employer:
- Your name linked to any usage data
- Your assessment results or scores
- Your community posts or AI coaching conversations
- Whether you specifically are using the service
- Any information that could identify you

- **Only with your explicit consent** for each referral
- **Only the minimum necessary information** for clinical care (e.g., "referred for ADHD screening")
- **Partners are bound by medical confidentiality** (more strict than employer agreement)

### ‚úÖ Shared WITH Crisis Services (If You're in Danger):
If you indicate immediate risk of harm to yourself or others:
- **Crisis helplines** (Samaritans, emergency services) may be contacted
- **This is for your safety** and follows established clinical protocols
- **Your employer is NOT notified** of crisis situations

## Community-Specific Privacy

### Facebook Communities (Current):

**What we can control:**
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced moderation** - Professional moderators screen all join requests and block employers
- ‚úÖ **Clear rules** - Anonymity required (pseudonyms, no face photos, no identifying details)
- ‚úÖ **Rapid enforcement** - Immediate removal of anyone who violates privacy rules

- ‚ùå **Facebook's data practices** - Facebook itself has access to posts (per their terms)

## Why This Matters

Mental health support only works if you feel safe to seek help without fear of judgment, monitoring, or retaliation.

**Research shows:**
- **70% of employees** won't use employer-provided mental health benefits if they fear being monitored
- **Confidentiality is the #1 barrier** to seeking workplace mental health support
- **Effective support requires trust** - You need to know your struggles won't be used against you

**That's why we built ClearMinds this way:**
- Your employer pays, but they **don't control or monitor** the service
- We put **your privacy first**, not employer convenience
- We're **legally bound** to protect your confidentiality
- We **actively block** employer snooping attempts

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can my employer see if I'm using ClearMinds?
**A:** No. They know how many total employees are using the service (e.g., "40 out of 100 employees"), but they don't know who specifically.

### Q: What if my manager finds out I'm in the community?
**A:** If you're using a pseudonym and no identifying details, they shouldn't recognize you. If they do (e.g., you mentioned a specific project), they are contractually prohibited from taking any action or sharing that knowledge. Report this to privacy@clearminds.com immediately.

### Q: Can I use my work email to register?
**A:** You can, but we recommend using a personal email for extra privacy. Work email means your employer might see emails from ClearMinds in their IT logs (though they still won't see content).

### Q: What if I'm referred to a specialist (like a psychiatrist or CBT therapist)?
**A:** Referrals are only made with your explicit consent. The specialist is bound by medical confidentiality (stricter than employer agreement) and will NOT share information with your employer unless you authorize it.

### Q: Can my employer ask me if I'm using ClearMinds?
**A:** They can ask, but you're not required to answer. It's your personal health information. If you feel pressured to disclose, that could be a violation of the non-retaliation clause‚Äîreport it.

### Q: What if I post something identifying in the community by accident?
**A:** Message a moderator immediately to delete the post. We monitor for identifying information and will proactively remove it if we catch it.

### Q: If I have a crisis, will my employer be notified?
**A:** No. Crisis situations are handled by independent crisis helplines (Samaritans, emergency services) and mental health professionals. Your employer is NOT notified.

### Q: Can I delete all my data if I change my mind?
**A:** Yes. Email privacy@clearminds.com with "Data Deletion Request" and we'll delete your account and personal data within 30 days. Aggregated data (no names) may be retained for service improvement.

### Q: What if my employer asks ClearMinds for my information?
**A:** We will refuse. Our contract with your employer explicitly prohibits us from sharing individual data. If they persist, we may terminate their contract.

### Q: How do I know this is real? Can I see the employer agreement?
**A:** Yes. Your employer has signed the "Employer Non-Snooping Agreement" which is legally binding. You can request a redacted copy (with your employer's signature) by emailing privacy@clearminds.com.
