# EMPLOYER NON-SNOOPING AGREEMENT
## ClearMinds B2B/EAP Community Access Policy

**Document Type:** Mandatory Contract Clause
**Effective Date:** [Contract Execution Date]
**Version:** 1.0
**Applicable To:** All ClearMinds B2B/EAP Contracts

---

## Purpose

This agreement protects employee confidentiality and psychological safety when accessing ClearMinds mental health support services, including peer support communities. This clause is **mandatory** in all ClearMinds B2B/EAP service agreements.

---

## 1. EMPLOYER NON-PARTICIPATION COVENANT

### 1.1 Prohibition on Monitoring
The Employer agrees that it shall **NOT**:

a) **Join, access, or attempt to access** any ClearMinds employee peer support community (including but not limited to Facebook groups, in-app communities, or any future community platforms)

b) **Monitor, track, or attempt to identify** which employees are participating in ClearMinds services or communities

c) **Request, demand, or solicit** from ClearMinds:
   - Names of participating employees
   - Content of employee posts or conversations
   - Individual usage data or engagement metrics
   - Any personally identifiable information linking specific employees to community participation

d) **Use proxies, third parties, or deceptive means** to circumvent this prohibition, including:
   - Having managers, HR staff, or contractors join communities
   - Using personal (non-work) email addresses to gain access
   - Requesting employees to share screenshots or content from communities
   - Any other means of indirect surveillance

### 1.2 Permitted Employer Access
The Employer **MAY** receive:

a) **Aggregated, anonymized analytics** showing:
   - Overall participation rates (% of eligible employees)
   - Top mental health pathways accessed (e.g., "30% stress/anxiety, 20% sleep issues")
   - Engagement trends over time (e.g., "participation increased 15% this quarter")

b) **Anonymization Threshold**: Individual-level data will ONLY be shared when aggregated groups contain ≥10 employees (k≥10 anonymity standard)

c) **Case Studies**: Anonymized, composite success stories with all identifying details removed

### 1.3 Rationale
Employee willingness to seek mental health support depends on absolute confidence that participation will not be monitored, tracked, or used against them by their employer. Any actual or perceived surveillance undermines the service's clinical effectiveness and violates employees' reasonable expectation of privacy.

## 2. EMPLOYER NON-RETALIATION COVENANT

### 2.1 Prohibition on Adverse Action
The Employer agrees that it shall **NOT**:

a) **Take adverse employment action** against any employee based on:
   - Participation or non-participation in ClearMinds services
   - Knowledge (however obtained) of an employee's mental health challenges
   - Content shared by employees in ClearMinds communities
   - Employee requests for mental health accommodations arising from ClearMinds assessments

b) **"Adverse employment action" includes**:
   - Termination or demotion
   - Denial of promotion or training opportunities
   - Reduction in compensation or benefits
   - Unfavorable shift assignments or work conditions
   - Negative performance reviews influenced by mental health status
   - Hostile work environment or harassment
   - Any other detriment to terms and conditions of employment

### 2.2 Accidental Exposure Protocol
If the Employer **accidentally learns** of an employee's participation (e.g., employee voluntarily discloses, visible community post due to Facebook privacy settings):

a) **Employer MUST**:
   - Immediately cease any further investigation or inquiry
   - Notify ClearMinds within **48 hours** of the accidental exposure
   - Document the circumstances in writing
   - Not share the information with any other employees or third parties

   - Work with the employee to address any privacy concerns
   - Implement additional safeguards to prevent future accidental exposures
