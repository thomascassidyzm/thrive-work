# CLEARMINDS COMMUNITY TERMS OF SERVICE
## Facebook Peer Support Group Rules & Legal Terms

**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Version:** 1.0
**Applies To:** All ClearMinds Facebook Community Members

---

## ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By joining and participating in the ClearMinds Facebook Community (the "Community"), you agree to these Terms of Service in addition to Facebook's Community Standards and Terms of Service.

**If you do not agree to these terms, do not join or participate in the Community.**

---

## 1. COMMUNITY PURPOSE

The ClearMinds Community provides peer support for mental health and wellness. This is a **safe, confidential space** for members to:
- Share experiences and coping strategies
- Support one another through challenges
- Access resources and information
- Connect with others on similar journeys

This Community is **NOT**:
- A replacement for professional mental health treatment
- A crisis intervention service (use 999 or Samaritans 116 123)
- A platform for solicitation, advertising, or commercial activity
- A medical advice or diagnosis service

---

## 2. MANDATORY ANONYMITY REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Required Practices
To protect your privacy and that of others, you **MUST**:

a) **Use a pseudonym** (not your real name) as your Facebook display name in this group
   - Examples: "Sarah M.", "Hopeful2025", "WellnessJourney"
   - NOT acceptable: Your full legal name

b) **Use an anonymous profile photo**
   - Acceptable: Avatar, landscape, generic image, illustration
   - NOT acceptable: Clear face photo, workplace ID photo, family photo with faces

c) **Never share identifying information** including:
   - Full real names (yours or others')
   - Workplace names or specific identifying details (e.g., "the only female engineer at XYZ Corp")
   - Home address, phone number, or precise location
   - Email address or other direct contact information
   - Photos showing faces, workplaces, or identifiable locations

### 2.2 Rationale
Anonymity protects you from:
- Employer identification and potential retaliation
- Privacy violations
- Discrimination or stigma
- Malicious actors or extortion attempts

**Your safety depends on maintaining anonymity. We strictly enforce these rules.**

---

## 3. PROHIBITED CONTENT & CONDUCT

### 3.1 Absolutely Prohibited
You **MUST NOT**:

a) **Screenshots or sharing content externally**
   - Do not screenshot, photograph, or copy/paste community posts to share outside the group
   - Do not share content on other social media, websites, or communication platforms
   - This violates community trust and confidentiality

b) **Harassment, bullying, or personal attacks**
   - Respectful disagreement is okay; personal attacks are not
   - No name-calling, insults, threats, or intimidation
   - No targeting members based on identity, mental health status, or personal struggles

c) **Promotion of self-harm or dangerous behaviors**
   - No pro-eating disorder ("pro-ana/pro-mia") content
   - No encouragement of self-harm, suicide, or substance abuse
   - No glorification or promotion of dangerous behaviors

d) **Medical advice, diagnosis, or prescription**
   - You may share your own experiences ("I found CBT helpful")
   - You may NOT diagnose others ("You definitely have ADHD")
   - You may NOT prescribe treatment ("You should take X medication")
   - **Direct people to professionals**, not personal medical opinions

e) **Spam, solicitation, or commercial promotion**
   - No advertising products, services, or businesses
   - No MLM recruitment or sales pitches
   - No soliciting donations or fundraising
   - No promoting external websites, apps, or services (except ClearMinds partners when relevant)

f) **Sharing private information (doxxing)**
   - Do not share others' personal information without consent
   - This includes real names, contact information, photos, or workplace details

g) **Political or religious debates**
   - This is a mental health support space, not a political or religious forum
   - Mentioning your own faith/values in the context of your wellness journey is okay
   - Proselytizing, debating, or criticizing others' beliefs is not

h) **Graphic or triggering content without warnings**
   - If discussing sensitive topics (self-harm, suicidal ideation, trauma, eating disorders), use content warnings
   - Example: "CW: self-harm" before discussing the topic
   - No graphic descriptions or images

i) **Employer monitoring or workplace infiltration**
   - Employers, managers, and HR staff are explicitly prohibited from joining this community
   - If you are an employer or manager at any company providing ClearMinds to employees, you may NOT participate
   - Attempting to identify employees or monitor participation is a breach of contract

### 3.2 Discouraged (Not Bannable, But Unhelpful)
Please avoid:
- Unsolicited advice (offer support, don't tell people what to do)
- Toxic positivity ("just think positive!") when someone is struggling
- One-upping ("you think that's bad, listen to my story")
- Dismissing or minimizing others' experiences
