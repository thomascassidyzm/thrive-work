---

## SLIDE 4: REQUIREMENT #1 - COMMUNITY (Proven)

### What We Have: 91,000 Active Members

**ClearMinds Consumer Community:**
- 91k members across Facebook groups
- 3 professional moderators (UK, US, Australia)
- 24/7 coverage with shift handoff protocols
- Crisis management experience (daily)
- Proven engagement: Higher than industry average

### B2B Community Enhancement:

**Phase 1 (Now - 6 Months): Enhanced Facebook**
- Private groups with enhanced moderation
- Employer infiltration detection
- Mandatory anonymity (pseudonyms, no face photos)
- Professional moderation (not employer surveillance)

**Phase 2 (Q3 2025): In-App Communities**
- Purpose-built anonymous platform
- Company segmentation (employers cannot access)
- Screenshot prevention technology
- Full data ownership (not Facebook)

**Talking Points:**
- We're not starting from zero - 91k members proves we can manage communities at scale
- Rachel Goodley leads moderation team - knows crisis management, toxic content removal, privacy protection
- Phase 1 uses Facebook (transparent about limitations) while Phase 2 builds stronger solution
- Towergate employees get access to proven community now + upgrade to in-app later

---

## SLIDE 5: COMMUNITY MODERATION AT SCALE

### Rachel's Team Track Record:

**Experience:**
- Managing 91k+ mental health community members
- Crisis interventions: Daily experience with suicidal ideation, self-harm, severe distress
- Content moderation: Removing harmful content (pro-ED, misinformation, harassment)
- Cultural management: Building supportive, compassionate community culture

### B2B-Specific Enhancements:

**Daily:**
- Review all join requests (cross-check against employer rosters)
- Scan posts for identifying information
- Monitor for employer infiltration attempts

**Weekly:**
- Compliance audit (anonymity check)
- Incident log review
- Escalation to leadership if employer snooping suspected

**24/7:**
- Crisis response (Samaritans, 999, NHS 111)
- Rule enforcement (harassment, doxxing, privacy violations)
- Member support

**Talking Points:**
- Rachel's team has seen it all - not theoretical, real-world experience
- B2B adds employer-snooping detection layer (new protocols documented)
- We've trained for this - Rachel's team knows how to protect employee privacy

---

## SLIDE 6: REQUIREMENT #2 - GOVERNANCE (Comprehensive)

### Legal Protections: Employer Non-Snooping Agreement

**Mandatory contract clause** in all B2B/EAP agreements:

✅ **Prohibits** employer monitoring, tracking, or identifying participants
✅ **Prohibits** retaliation for using mental health support
✅ **Requires** 48-hour notification of accidental exposure
✅ **Breach consequences**: Contract termination + £10,000 per affected employee
✅ **Employee legal rights**: Tribunal claims, discrimination complaints, data protection

**This is not a policy - it's a legally enforceable contract.**

**Talking Points:**
- We contractually prohibit what employees fear most: employer snooping
- Breach has real teeth: £10k per affected employee + contract termination
- Gives Towergate legal cover: "We're prohibited from monitoring by contract"
- Employees see this and trust the service (drives engagement)

---

## SLIDE 7: DATA GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

### Privacy-First Architecture:

**What Employers CANNOT See:**
- Who is using ClearMinds (individual names, participation)
- What employees share (posts, AI coaching topics, assessment results)
- Community activity (who posted, who commented, what was said)

**What Employers CAN See (Aggregated Only):**
- Participation rate (e.g., "40% of employees are using the service")
- Top pathways (e.g., "30% stress, 25% sleep, 20% mood")
- Engagement trends (e.g., "Usage increased 15% this quarter")

**Anonymization Standard:** k≥10 (data only shared when groups contain ≥10 employees)

### UK GDPR Compliance:

✅ Privacy notice published
✅ Data minimization (collect only necessary data)
✅ Subject access requests (SAR) process
✅ Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
✅ ICO registration (in progress)
✅ Data protection impact assessment (DPIA) completed
✅ Cyber Essentials Plus (in progress)

**Talking Points:**
- We follow Headspace/Calm precedent: mental health data is NOT shared with employers
- k≥10 anonymization is industry standard (prevents reverse-engineering identity)
- UK GDPR compliance is non-negotiable - we've built it in from day one
- Cyber Essentials Plus gives Towergate confidence in our security posture

---

## SLIDE 8: RISK MANAGEMENT (Documented & Mitigated)

### We Identified 8 Privacy/Safety Risks:

| Risk | Inherent | Mitigated | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Employer identification | Critical | Medium | ✅ Acceptable |
| Extortion/blackmail | High | Medium | ✅ Acceptable |
| Data scraping | Medium | Low | ✅ Acceptable |
| Accidental self-disclosure | High | Low | ✅ Acceptable |
| Crisis response inadequacy | High | Medium | ✅ Acceptable |
| Regulatory non-compliance | High | Low | ✅ Acceptable |
| Facebook platform dependency | Medium | Low | ✅ Acceptable |
| Community toxicity | Medium | Low | ✅ Acceptable |

### Mitigation Strategies Include:

- Employer non-snooping contract
- Enhanced moderation protocols
- 24/7 crisis coverage
- Mandatory anonymity enforcement
- Phase 2 in-app communities (stronger protections)

**Talking Points:**
- We're not hiding risks - we identified them, assessed them, mitigated them
- This is what good governance looks like: documented risk assessment + clear mitigations
- Enterprise buyers need to see we've thought through worst-case scenarios
- Phase 2 (in-app) reduces all risks by 1-2 levels

---

## SLIDE 9: REQUIREMENT #3 - EFFICACY (Proven Model + Pilot Data)

### Current Evidence: 70,000 Paying Users

**ClearMinds Hypnotherapy App:**
- 70k paying users at £12.50/month
- £10.5M annual recurring revenue
- Proves engagement model works at scale
- Users pay out-of-pocket (not free trial inflation)

**What This Proves:**
- People find the service valuable (retention)
- Mental health support model is effective
- Not just signups - sustained usage

### Workplace-Specific Evidence (Pilot Will Provide):

**6-Month Pilot with 100-500 Employees:**
- Engagement rates (30-40% target vs 5-10% traditional EAP)
- Neuroindicator score improvements (baseline → 6 months)
- Self-reported outcomes (stress, sleep, mood, focus)
- Sick day correlation (if employer shares data)
- ROI analysis (engagement × cost per user vs traditional EAP)

**Deliverables After Pilot:**
- Case study with outcome data
- Testimonials from pilot employees
- Engagement metrics comparison (vs traditional EAP benchmarks)
- Evidence of efficacy for full-scale deployment

**Talking Points:**
- We're not asking you to take efficacy on faith - pilot will prove it
- 70k paying users proves the core model works
- Pilot adds workplace-specific validation
- 6 months is enough time to see engagement patterns and outcome trends

---

## SLIDE 10: THE COMPLETE CLEARMINDS EAP OFFERING

### Employee Journey:

**1. Entry: Neuroindicator Screening (15 questions, 5-10 min)**
- Clinically validated (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ASRS, ISI)
- 7 outcome pathways (crisis, wellness, stress, mood, focus, sleep, general)
- Intelligent triage (not one-size-fits-all)

**2. Pathway Routing:**

| Pathway | ClearMinds Support | Partner Support |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Crisis** | Community + AI coaching | Crisis helpline (Anxiety UK/CALM) |
| **Stress/Anxiety** | ClearMinds app + AI coaching | CBT therapist (6 sessions/year) |
| **Mood** | ClearMinds app + AI coaching | GP referral + CBT |
| **Attention/Focus** | Workplace assessment | SmartStartMinds (ADHD screening) |
| **Sleep** | ClearMinds sleep programs | Sleep specialist referral |
| **Baseline Wellness** | Community + wellness content | Preventative resources |

**3. Ongoing Support:**
- Peer community (Facebook → in-app Q3 2025)
- AI coaching (Tom, Alastair, Lucy, Edward, Kainne, Dom)
- ClearMinds hypnotherapy app (70k proven users)
- Specialist referrals when needed

**Talking Points:**
- This isn't just a community - it's a complete mental health ecosystem
- Neuroindicator routes employees to right support (not generic helpline)
- We own the AI coaching + hypnotherapy (privacy-controlled)
- Partners for crisis + specialized therapy (where we refer out, not core)

---

## SLIDE 11: AI COACHING - SPECIALIZED & PROVEN

### 6 Expert Coaches (Built-In, Not Referral):

| Coach | Specialty | Use Cases |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Tom** | Identity & Purpose | Career transitions, values alignment, life direction |
| **Alastair** | Health & Wellness | ADHD, OCD, stress management, health anxiety |
| **Lucy** | CBT Specialist | "The Script Method" - thought patterns, behavior change |
| **Edward** | Workplace Wellness | Team dynamics, work stress, burnout prevention |
| **Kainne** | Leadership & Time | Work-life balance, boundaries, time management |
| **Dom** | Team Performance | Group dynamics, collaboration, competition |

### Why This Matters for Privacy:

✅ **Owned by ClearMinds** (not third-party referral like Limitless/cowchapp)
✅ **Privacy-controlled** (your data stays with ClearMinds)
✅ **24/7 availability** (not appointment-based)
✅ **Unlimited sessions** (no caps like traditional EAP)
✅ **Enhancement system** (AI learns from successful conversations, gets better over time)

**Talking Points:**
- Traditional EAPs say "call this helpline" (one-size-fits-all)
- We have specialized coaches for different issues (personalized)
- Privacy advantage: We own it end-to-end (no third-party data sharing)
- Enhancement system means service gets better over time (learns from 70k users)

---

## SLIDE 12: PHASED COMMUNITY APPROACH (Honest & Strategic)

### Why Two Phases?

**Reality:** Facebook communities have limitations (screenshots, platform dependency)
**Strategy:** Be transparent, offer interim solution, commit to better long-term

### Phase 1: Enhanced Facebook (Now - 6 Months)

**What It Is:**
- Private Facebook groups with professional moderation
- Employer non-snooping contractually enforced
- Enhanced vetting (employer infiltration detection)
- Crisis protocols, anonymity rules

**Limitations (We're Honest About):**
- Cannot fully prevent screenshots (though prohibited and enforced)
- Facebook has access to posts (third-party platform)
- Not 100% employer-blocking (if they use personal email + fake name)

**Why It Works:**
- Better than no community at all
- 91k members proves engagement model
- Legal protections give employees confidence
- Clear upgrade path to Phase 2

### Phase 2: In-App Communities (Q3 2025)

**What We're Building:**
- Purpose-built anonymous platform
- Mandatory anonymous usernames (no real names possible)
- Company segmentation (employers technically cannot access)
- Screenshot prevention technology
- Full data ownership (not Facebook)
- End-to-end encryption

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates Facebook limitations
- True anonymity (technical enforcement, not just policy)
- Employer separation (coded into architecture)
- Best-in-class privacy

**Talking Points:**
- Most competitors hide limitations - we're transparent
- Phase 1 is "good enough" for pilot + early deployment
- Phase 2 is "best in class" for long-term
- Employees appreciate honesty ("Facebook for now, better option coming")
- Towergate can market: "We provide BOTH proven community now AND cutting-edge platform later"

## SLIDE 13: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING

### ClearMinds vs Traditional EAPs

| Feature | Traditional EAP | ClearMinds |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Engagement** | 5-10% utilization | 30-40% target |
| **Triage** | Generic helpline | Intelligent Neuroindicator routing |
| **Community** | None or minimal | 91k active members, 24/7 moderation |
| **AI Coaching** | None | 6 specialized coaches, 24/7 unlimited |
| **Hypnotherapy** | None | 70k proven users, on-demand |
| **Privacy** | Varies | Employer non-snooping contract |
| **Cost** | £15-50/employee/year | £60-80/employee/year |
| **Cost Per User** | £500/user (5% engage) | £229/user (35% engage) |

**Key Insight:** Better to pay £80 with 35% engagement than £30 with 6% engagement. **We're cheaper per actual user.**

### ClearMinds vs Therapy Apps (BetterHelp, Talkspace)

| Feature | BetterHelp/Talkspace | ClearMinds |
|---------|---------------------|------------|
| **Cost** | $300-400/month/user | £6-8/month (corporate pricing) |
| **Scope** | Therapy only | Full ecosystem (screening, coaching, community, hypnotherapy, referrals) |
| **Privacy** | Individual app (employer unaware) | B2B with employer non-snooping guarantee |

### ClearMinds vs Wellness Apps (Calm, Headspace)

| Feature | Calm/Headspace | ClearMinds |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| **Clinical Triage** | None | Neuroindicator → pathways |
| **Specialized Support** | Generic meditation | AI coaches, CBT, ADHD screening, crisis, sleep |
| **Community** | None | 91k members, 24/7 moderation |

**Our Unique Position:** Only solution with intelligent clinical triage + AI coaching + hypnotherapy + specialist pathways + community + employer non-snooping guarantee.

**Talking Points:**
- Traditional EAPs: Cheap but nobody uses them (expensive per actual user)
- Therapy apps: Good for individuals, not designed for B2B privacy needs
- Wellness apps: Generic, no clinical depth
- ClearMinds: Complete ecosystem with privacy built in from day one

| **Value per actual user** | Low (generic helpline) | High (personalized triage + coaching + community) |

**Bottom Line:** ClearMinds is **cheaper per actual user** despite 2.5x higher price, because **6x more employees actually use it**.

**Talking Points:**
- Traditional EAPs are "cheap" but wasteful (5-10% use it)
- ClearMinds is "premium priced" but cost-effective (30-40% use it)
- Employers care about impact, not just cost

**4. ROI & Cost Efficiency**
- Lower cost per actual user (despite higher price per employee)
- Reduced absenteeism, presenteeism, turnover from better mental health
- Preventative approach catches issues before they become expensive crises

**5. Scalability & White-Label Potential**

## SLIDE 19: QUESTIONS & DISCUSSION

### Common Questions We Anticipate:

**Q: Why Facebook for Phase 1? Aren't there privacy risks?**
**A:** Yes, Facebook has limitations (we're transparent about them). We've mitigated risks with:
- Employer non-snooping contract (legal enforcement)
- Enhanced moderation (employer infiltration detection)
- Mandatory anonymity (pseudonyms, no faces)
- Phase 2 in-app communities (Q3 2025) eliminate Facebook dependency

**Q: What if employees don't engage? We've tried EAPs before and nobody used them.**
**A:** ClearMinds is different because:
- Intelligent triage (not generic helpline)
- AI coaching 24/7 (not appointment-based)
- Community (peer support, not just professional)
- Proven model: 70k paying users proves engagement
- Target: 30-40% engagement vs 5-10% traditional

**Q: How do you guarantee employer privacy?**
**A:** Three layers:
- Legal: Non-snooping contract with £10k per employee breach penalty
- Technical: k≥10 anonymization, separate data systems
- Operational: 24/7 moderation detects and blocks employer infiltration

**Q: What's the ROI?**
**A:** Pilot will prove it, but:
- £229 per actual user (vs £500 traditional EAP)
- Preventative (catches issues before expensive crises)
- Reduced absenteeism, presenteeism, turnover
- Employee attraction and retention value

**Q: Can we white-label this for our customers?**
**A:** Absolutely. If pilot succeeds:
- Towergate can distribute to SME customers
- Bundle with insurance products
- Your brand, our tech
- Recurring revenue stream
