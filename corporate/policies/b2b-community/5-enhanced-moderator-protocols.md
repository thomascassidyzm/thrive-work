# ENHANCED MODERATOR PROTOCOLS
## B2B/EAP Community Moderation Guidelines

**For:** Rachel Goodley & ClearMinds Moderation Team
**Document Type:** Internal Operational Procedures
**Effective Date:** [B2B Launch Date]
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Purpose

This document outlines **B2B-specific moderation procedures** for employer-sponsored communities. These protocols **supplement** (not replace) your existing moderation practices for the 91k consumer community.

**Key Difference:** B2B communities have **stricter privacy requirements** due to employer-employee dynamics and contractual obligations.

---

## Section 1: MEMBER APPROVAL PROCESS (Enhanced for B2B)

### Consumer Community (Current):
- Check for real names → Request pseudonym
- Check for clear face photos → Request anonymous photo
- Approve if compliant

### B2B Community (New Requirements):

#### Step 1: Initial Screening (Same as Consumer)
- **Check display name**: Must be pseudonym (not full legal name)
  - ✅ Approve: "Sarah M.", "HopefulJourney", "WellnessSeeker"
  - ❌ Deny: "Sarah Johnson", "Sarah.Johnson.Engineer"
- **Check profile photo**: Must be anonymous
  - ✅ Approve: Avatar, landscape, abstract, Facebook default
  - ❌ Deny: Clear face photo, workplace ID, family photo

#### Step 2: Cross-Reference Against Employer List (NEW FOR B2B)
- **Check join request email/name** against employer employee roster (if provided)
  - Purpose: Detect if request is from an employer/manager trying to infiltrate
  - **Red flags**:
    - Email domain matches employer domain (e.g., @companyx.com)
    - Name matches known manager or HR personnel
    - Multiple join requests from same company in short time period

- **If red flag detected**:
  - **Deny request** immediately
  - **Document** in Employer Snooping Log (see Section 6)
  - **Escalate** to Tom Cassidy (CDO) within 24 hours
  - **Email employer** if suspected breach: privacy@clearminds.com

#### Step 3: Approve or Request Changes
- **If compliant**: Approve and welcome to group
- **If non-compliant (not employer snooping, just needs fix)**: Send standard message:

> "Welcome to ClearMinds! To protect everyone's privacy, please update your profile before joining:
> 1. Change your display name to a pseudonym (not your full legal name)
> 2. Change your profile photo to something anonymous (no clear face)
> Once updated, request to join again and we'll approve you quickly. Questions? community@clearminds.com"

## Section 2: DAILY MONITORING CHECKLIST (B2B-Specific)

**In addition to your existing daily tasks**, B2B communities require:

### Every Morning (Within 1 Hour of Shift Start):
- [ ] **Review pending join requests** (check for employer infiltration attempts)
- [ ] **Scan recent posts for identifying information** (real names, workplace details)
- [ ] **Check for employer domain emails** in join requests (compare to company roster)
- [ ] **Review crisis posts** from overnight (if any) and confirm proper resources were provided

### Every Afternoon (Mid-Shift):
- [ ] **Second review of join requests** (in case missed in morning)
- [ ] **Scan for rule violations** posted during day
- [ ] **Check moderator inbox** for member reports or concerns
- [ ] **Monitor engagement** (are members posting/commenting? Any unusual patterns?)

### Every Evening (End of Shift):
- [ ] **Final scan for crisis posts** or serious violations
- [ ] **Update handoff notes** for next shift (document anything requiring follow-up)
- [ ] **Log any incidents** in shared tracking sheet

---

## Section 3: WEEKLY COMPLIANCE AUDIT (NEW FOR B2B)

**Every Monday morning (or first shift of week):**

### Audit Checklist:
- [ ] **Review member list** (alphabetically) for any full legal names or clear face photos that slipped through
  - If found: Private message member requesting change (see template in Section 8)
  - If member doesn't respond within 48 hours: Temporarily remove until compliant

- [ ] **Check for identifying information in posts** from past 7 days
  - Search for: Full names, specific company names, address details, phone numbers, emails
  - If found: Remove post, message member with reminder (see template in Section 8)

- [ ] **Review employer roster** (if updated) for new managers/HR staff who might attempt to join

- [ ] **Document findings** in Weekly Compliance Report (see template in Section 9)

- [ ] **Escalate concerns** to Tom Cassidy if any employer snooping suspected

---

## Section 4: EMPLOYER SNOOPING DETECTION & RESPONSE

### Red Flags Indicating Possible Employer Infiltration:

**Join Request Indicators:**
- Email domain matches employer domain (e.g., @companyx.com for CompanyX employees)
- Name matches known manager, HR staff, or executive (check roster)
- Multiple join requests from same employer in short time (could be organized infiltration)
- Generic/fake-sounding pseudonym with brand new Facebook account (created same day)

**Member Behavior Indicators (AFTER Approval):**
- Member asks unusually specific questions trying to identify others ("Does anyone work at CompanyX's London office?")
- Member seems more interested in gathering information than providing support
- Member private messages multiple people asking identifying questions
- Member screenshots posts (other members may report this)

**Reporting by Other Members:**
- "I think this person is from my HR department"
- "Someone private messaged me asking where I work"
- "I saw [member name] at work and they're a manager"

### Immediate Response Protocol:

**If employer snooping suspected:**

1. **DO NOT confront publicly** - Do not post in group or call out member

2. **Immediately remove member** from group (use "Remove Member" not just deny pending request)

3. **Document incident** in Employer Snooping Log:
   - Date/time
   - Member name (Facebook name used)
   - Email address (if available)
   - Employer company
   - Reason for suspicion (specific red flags)
   - Actions taken

4. **Escalate to Tom Cassidy** within 2 hours (email: tom@clearminds.com + privacy@clearminds.com)
   - Include all documentation
   - Include screenshots if available

5. **DO NOT notify employer yet** - Wait for Tom's instruction (he will handle contract breach notification)

6. **Monitor for re-join attempts** - Add email/name to watch list

7. **If member had interacted with other members**, consider:
   - Private message to members they contacted: "We've removed a member who violated our confidentiality policy. If they contacted you privately, please do not share any personal information. If you're concerned, contact privacy@clearminds.com."

---

## Section 5: CRISIS ESCALATION (Same as Consumer, But Extra Documentation for B2B)

**No changes to your existing crisis protocol**, but for B2B communities:

### Additional Documentation Required:
- **Record crisis incidents** in separate B2B Crisis Log (do NOT share with employer)
- **Confirm employer is NOT notified** (this is critical - employers must never learn of employee crisis situations)
- **Document that proper resources were provided** (999, Samaritans 116 123, NHS 111)

### Crisis Response Template (Same as Consumer):
1. **Respond immediately** (within minutes if online, or tag another moderator)
2. **Private message member** with crisis resources
3. **Remove graphic content** if triggering to others (while supporting individual)
4. **Contact emergency services** if immediate risk and location known
5. **Document** in crisis log

**For B2B:** Employer is NEVER notified of crisis situations (per contract). Direct member to professional resources only.

---

## Section 6: INCIDENT LOGGING & DOCUMENTATION

#### 1. **Employer Snooping Log** (Highly Confidential)

2. **Private message member**:
> "Hi [pseudonym], we've removed your post because it contained identifying workplace details (company name + specific role + location).

**Subject:** Community Participation Concern

> Hi [name],
>
> We've noticed some concerns about your participation in the ClearMinds Community that suggest you may not be eligible for membership.

## Section 12: MODERATOR SELF-CARE

**B2B moderation can be more stressful** due to employer-employee dynamics and privacy risks.

**Remember:**
- ✅ You're protecting employees from real privacy risks (employer retaliation, discrimination)
- ✅ Your vigilance prevents serious harm (job loss, stigma, legal issues)
- ✅ It's okay to escalate when unsure - Tom and Rachel are here to support you
- ✅ Take breaks when exposed to heavy content (crisis posts, trauma)
- ✅ Use ClearMinds services yourself (AI coaching, hypnotherapy app) - you're eligible!

**If you're feeling burnt out or overwhelmed:**
- Talk to Rachel
- Use internal support resources
- Take mental health days when needed
- Remember: You can't pour from an empty cup
