## MODAL SCREEN 1: INITIAL WARNING

### Modal Title:
**Before You Join the ClearMinds Community**

### Modal Body:

üëã **Welcome!** Our peer support community is here to connect you with others on similar mental health journeys.

Before you join, there are a few important things to know about **privacy and safety**.

---

**üì± This Community Uses Facebook (For Now)**

Our community currently runs on Facebook while we build our own in-app platform (coming Q3 2025).

**What this means for you:**

‚úÖ **What we CAN protect:**
- Your employer **cannot** access this community (contractually prohibited)
- Professional moderators (not your employer) monitor 24/7
- Enhanced vetting process to block employer join attempts
- Private group (only approved members see posts)

‚ùå **What we CANNOT fully prevent (Facebook limitations):**
- **Screenshots** - Facebook doesn't let us disable screenshots (though taking them is against our rules and may result in removal)
- **Facebook's data practices** - Facebook itself has access to posts per their platform terms
- **100% anonymity guarantee** - We require pseudonyms, but we can't prevent all identification if you share too many personal details

---

**üîí How to Protect Yourself:**

**REQUIRED (Strictly Enforced):**
- ‚úÖ Use a **pseudonym** (not your real name) as your display name
- ‚úÖ Use an **anonymous profile photo** (avatar, landscape, no face)
- ‚úÖ **Never share** identifying information (real names, workplace details, specific identifying details)

**RECOMMENDED (For Extra Safety):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Share wisely - Only post what you'd be comfortable potentially becoming public
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use a personal email (not work email) for Facebook account
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid oversharing specific details that could identify you

---

**üöÄ Better Privacy is Coming:**

We're building an **in-app anonymous community** (launching Q3 2025) with:
- Mandatory anonymous usernames (no real names allowed)
- Company segmentation (employers technically cannot access)
- Screenshot prevention technology
- Full data ownership (not on Facebook)

**You can wait for the in-app version if you prefer stronger privacy protections.**

## TONE & VOICE

**Approach**: Transparent, protective, empowering (not alarmist)

**DO**:
- Be honest about limitations
- Empower users to make informed choices
- Acknowledge Facebook's inherent risks
- Offer clear alternatives (wait for in-app)
- Emphasize what we DO protect (employer cannot access)

**DON'T**:
- Minimize risks ("it's totally safe!")
- Overwhelm with legal jargon
- Scare users away from joining
- Make promises we can't keep
- Hide Facebook limitations

**Remember**: Users need to trust that we're being straight with them. Transparency builds trust, even when acknowledging limitations.
