            <p>Safeguarding means protecting an adult's right to live in safety, free from abuse and neglect. Under the <strong>Care Act 2014</strong>, safeguarding duties apply to adults who:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have needs for care and support (whether or not the local authority is meeting any of those needs)</li>
                <li>Are experiencing, or at risk of, abuse or neglect</li>
                <li>As a result of those care and support needs, are unable to protect themselves</li>

            <h2>7. Designated Safeguarding Lead Actions</h2>
            <p>Upon receiving a concern, the DSL will:</p>

            <h3>7.1 Immediate Assessment (Same Day)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluate the level of risk and urgency</li>
                <li>Ensure the person is currently safe</li>
                <li>Decide whether to make an immediate referral to statutory services</li>
                <li>Consider whether police involvement is required</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.2 Making a Safeguarding Referral</h3>
            <p>If the three-part test is met (adult with care/support needs + experiencing abuse + unable to protect self), the DSL will refer to:</p>

            <p><strong>Local Authority Safeguarding Adults Team</strong><br>
            Contact details vary by service user's local authority area. DSL maintains current contact list.</p>

            <p><strong>Referral methods:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Online referral form (most local authorities)</li>
                <li>Phone referral to Adult Social Care duty team</li>
                <li>Email to safeguarding team (confirm receipt)</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Information to include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adult's details (name, DOB, address, contact info)</li>
                <li>Nature of concern and type of abuse suspected</li>
                <li>Consent status (has the adult consented to the referral?)</li>
                <li>Current risk and safety status</li>
                <li>Details of alleged perpetrator (if known)</li>
                <li>Any immediate action taken</li>
                <li>Contact details for referrer (DSL)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.3 When to Involve Police</h3>
            <p>Contact police immediately if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A criminal offence may have been committed</li>
                <li>There is immediate risk to life or serious injury</li>
                <li>Evidence needs to be preserved (e.g., scene of crime)</li>
                <li>The person is unable to report themselves and requests help</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7.4 Record Keeping</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All safeguarding records stored securely and separately from clinical notes</li>
                <li>Access restricted to DSL, Deputy DSL, and senior management</li>
                <li>Retained for 7 years minimum (or longer if ongoing case)</li>
                <li>Compliant with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Consent and Information Sharing</h2>

            <h3>8.1 General Rule: Seek Consent</h3>
            <p>Wherever possible, obtain the adult's consent before sharing information with safeguarding agencies. Explain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why you are concerned</li>
                <li>What information you need to share</li>
                <li>Who you need to share it with</li>
                <li>What is likely to happen as a result</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8.2 Sharing Without Consent</h3>
            <div class="critical-box">
                <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è When Consent Can Be Overridden</h3>
                <p>Information may be shared <strong>without consent</strong> when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The person lacks mental capacity to consent (Mental Capacity Act 2005) and sharing is in their best interests</li>
                    <li>There is a risk to others (e.g., children or other vulnerable adults)</li>
                    <li>A serious crime has been or may be committed</li>
                    <li>There is an overriding public interest</li>
                    <li>There is a court order or statutory duty to share</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Document the decision-making process and reasons for overriding consent.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>8.3 Information Sharing Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Share on a need-to-know basis only</li>
                <li>Share the minimum information necessary</li>
                <li>Distinguish between fact and opinion</li>
                <li>Ensure information is accurate and up-to-date</li>
                <li>Record what was shared, with whom, when, and why</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Mental Capacity and Safeguarding</h2>
            <p>Under the <strong>Mental Capacity Act 2005</strong>, we must assume an adult has capacity unless proven otherwise.</p>

            <h3>9.1 Five Principles of Mental Capacity Act</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Presumption of capacity</li>
                <li>Support to make decisions</li>
                <li>Right to make unwise decisions</li>
                <li>Best interests (if lacks capacity)</li>
                <li>Least restrictive option</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>9.2 Capacity Assessment</h3>
            <p>An adult lacks capacity if they cannot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Understand</strong> the information relevant to the decision</li>
                <li><strong>Retain</strong> that information</li>
                <li><strong>Use or weigh</strong> the information as part of decision-making</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate</strong> their decision</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Capacity is decision-specific and time-specific. A person may lack capacity for complex financial decisions but have capacity to decide about personal care.</p>

            <h3>9.3 Best Interests Decisions</h3>
            <p>If an adult lacks capacity, decisions must be made in their best interests, considering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The person's past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs, and values</li>
                <li>Views of family, carers, and others with an interest</li>
                <li>Whether capacity might be regained</li>
                <li>The least restrictive option</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Allegations Against Staff or Volunteers</h2>
            <p>If a service user, colleague, or external party alleges that a ClearMinds staff member or therapist has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Behaved in a way that has harmed, or may have harmed, a service user</li>
                <li>Committed a criminal offence</li>
                <li>Behaved in a way that indicates unsuitability to work with vulnerable adults</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Immediate actions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Report immediately to Clinical Director or Managing Director (not the DSL if they are implicated)</li>
                <li>Consider suspension pending investigation (not an assumption of guilt)</li>
                <li>Refer to Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) if required by local procedures</li>
                <li>Notify CQC within required timeframes (serious incident notification)</li>
                <li>Cooperate fully with police investigations</li>
                <li>Consider referral to professional regulatory bodies (NCH, BACP, UKCP)</li>
                <li>Review and learn from the incident to prevent recurrence</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Safeguarding Training</h2>
            <p>All staff receive safeguarding training appropriate to their role:</p>

            </table>

            <p>Training records maintained by HR and reviewed during supervision and appraisals.</p>

            <h2>12. Safer Recruitment</h2>
            <p>To prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable adults, ClearMinds follows robust recruitment procedures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhanced DBS checks for all clinical staff and roles with service user contact</li>
                <li>DBS checks renewed every 3 years</li>
                <li>Right to work checks and verification of qualifications</li>
                <li>Two professional references (one from most recent employer)</li>
                <li>Gaps in employment history explored during interview</li>
                <li>Registration with professional bodies verified (NCH, BACP, UKCP)</li>
                <li>Safeguarding questions during interview process</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>13. Confidentiality vs. Safeguarding</h2>
            <p>While we respect client confidentiality, safeguarding concerns <strong>override confidentiality</strong> in certain circumstances.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Our Approach to Confidentiality</h4>
                <p><strong>What we tell clients at the start of therapy:</strong></p>
                <p>"Everything you tell me is confidential, except in three situations where I have a legal or ethical duty to share information:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If I'm concerned about your immediate safety or someone else's safety</li>
                    <li>If you disclose abuse or harm involving a child or vulnerable adult</li>
                    <li>If I'm required by law to disclose (e.g., court order, terrorism concerns)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>If any of these situations arise, I'll talk to you about what I need to do, unless doing so would increase risk."</p>
            </div>

            <h2>14. Reporting to CQC</h2>
            <p>ClearMinds must notify CQC <strong>without delay</strong> of certain safeguarding incidents:</p>

            <h3>Notifiable Safeguarding Incidents (Regulation 18)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abuse or allegations of abuse by staff, service users, or others</li>
                <li>Incidents reported to or investigated by police</li>
                <li>Safeguarding referrals made to local authorities</li>
                <li>Serious injury or harm to service users</li>
                <li>Deprivation of liberty safeguards (DoLS) applications</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>How to notify CQC:</strong> Online notification via CQC portal within timeframes specified in Regulation 18.</p>

            <h2>15. Multi-Agency Working</h2>
            <p>Effective safeguarding requires collaboration with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Safeguarding Adults Boards (SABs):</strong> Strategic partnerships coordinating safeguarding</li>
                <li><strong>Adult Social Care:</strong> Assessment and safeguarding investigations (Section 42 enquiries)</li>
                <li><strong>Police:</strong> Criminal investigations and immediate protection</li>
                <li><strong>NHS services:</strong> GPs, mental health teams, hospitals</li>
                <li><strong>Housing providers:</strong> Especially for domestic abuse and homelessness</li>
                <li><strong>Employers:</strong> If abuse is workplace-related</li>
                <li><strong>Advocacy services:</strong> Independent support for service users</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>16. Safeguarding Culture at ClearMinds</h2>
            <p>We are committed to creating an organizational culture where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Safeguarding is everyone's responsibility</li>
                <li>Staff feel confident to raise concerns without fear of reprisal</li>
                <li>Service users are empowered and their voices heard</li>
                <li>Continuous learning from incidents and near misses</li>
                <li>Regular supervision includes safeguarding reflection</li>
                <li>Policies are accessible, understood, and followed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>17. Policy Review and Monitoring</h2>
            <p>This policy is reviewed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Annually as a minimum</li>
                <li>Following serious safeguarding incidents</li>
                <li>When legislation or guidance changes</li>
                <li>After CQC inspections or safeguarding audits</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Clinical Governance Committee monitors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number and types of safeguarding concerns raised</li>
                <li>Referrals made to statutory agencies</li>
                <li>Staff training compliance rates</li>
                <li>Learning from safeguarding incidents</li>
                <li>CQC notifications and outcomes</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>Remember: Safeguarding is Everyone's Responsibility</h4>
                <p>If you see something that concerns you, say something. It is better to report a concern that turns out to be nothing than to stay silent and allow harm to continue.</p>
