            <h2>4. Data Protection Principles</h2>
            
            <p>We adhere to the seven key principles of data protection:</p>

            <h3>4.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency</h3>
            <p>We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We provide clear information about how we use personal data through privacy notices and ensure individuals understand what data we collect and why.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Purpose Limitation</h3>
            <p>We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes only. We do not process data in ways incompatible with those purposes without obtaining fresh consent or having another lawful basis.</p>

            <h3>4.3 Data Minimisation</h3>
            <p>We only collect and process personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.</p>

            <h3>4.4 Accuracy</h3>
            <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Inaccurate data is rectified or deleted without delay.</p>

            <h3>4.5 Storage Limitation</h3>
            <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, in line with our Data Retention Policy.</p>

            <h3>4.6 Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)</h3>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.</p>

            <h3>4.7 Accountability</h3>
            <p>We demonstrate compliance with these principles through documentation, policies, procedures, training, and regular audits.</p>

            <h2>5. Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
            
            <p>We only process personal data where we have a lawful basis under Article 6 of UK GDPR:</p>

            <h3>5.1 Standard Personal Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> The individual has given clear consent for us to process their data</li>
                <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing is necessary for performance of a contract with the individual</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> Processing is necessary to comply with the law</li>
                <li><strong>Vital interests:</strong> Processing is necessary to protect someone's life</li>
                <li><strong>Public task:</strong> Processing is necessary to perform a task in the public interest</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> Processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (unless overridden by individual's rights)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 Special Category Data (Health Data)</h3>
            <p>For health data, we also require a condition under Article 9 UK GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explicit consent:</strong> The individual has given explicit consent (e.g., accepting terms when booking counselling)</li>
                <li><strong>Health/social care purposes:</strong> Processing is necessary for health or social care purposes (Article 9(2)(h))</li>
                <li><strong>Public health:</strong> Processing in the public interest in public health</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert-box">
                <strong>⚠️ Special Category Data Handling:</strong> Health data requires additional safeguards. All staff must complete specialist training on handling health data and follow strict confidentiality procedures.
            </div>

            <h2>6. Data Subject Rights</h2>
            
            <p>Individuals have the following rights under UK GDPR:</p>

            <h3>6.1 Right to be Informed</h3>

            <p>Individuals can request correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data. We update records promptly upon receiving such requests.</p>

            <h3>6.4 Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten')</h3>
            <p>In certain circumstances, individuals can request deletion of their personal data. This right is not absolute - we may need to retain data for legal or regulatory reasons.</p>

            <h3>6.5 Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
            <p>Individuals can request that we limit how we use their data in certain circumstances (e.g., while accuracy is verified).</p>

            </ul>

            <p>We maintain records of when and how consent was obtained and keep this information for the duration of the relationship plus 2 years.</p>
