# Clinical Supervision Policy

## 1. Policy Statement

ClearMinds is committed to providing high-quality, safe, and effective therapeutic services. Clinical supervision is central to this commitment, ensuring that all therapists receive regular, structured support to maintain professional standards, develop competence, and safeguard service users.

This policy establishes the framework for clinical supervision at ClearMinds, ensuring compliance with professional body requirements (BACP, UKCP, NCH) and CQC expectations for clinical governance and quality assurance.

### Purpose of Clinical Supervision

Clinical supervision serves three essential functions:

- **Normative:** Quality assurance, professional accountability, adherence to standards and ethics
- **Formative:** Professional development, skill enhancement, reflective practice
- **Restorative:** Emotional support, prevention of burnout, therapist wellbeing

Effective supervision protects service users, supports therapists, and maintains organisational quality standards.

## 2. Scope and Application

### 2.1 Who Must Receive Supervision?

**All clinical staff** providing therapy or hypnotherapy services at ClearMinds must receive regular clinical supervision, including:

- Fully qualified therapists and hypnotherapists
- Trainee and newly qualified practitioners
- Supervisors themselves (receiving supervision from another qualified supervisor)
- Clinical Director (peer supervision or external supervision)

**No exceptions:** Supervision is mandatory regardless of experience level or professional seniority.

### 2.2 Types of Supervision at ClearMinds

- **Individual supervision:** One-to-one sessions with designated supervisor (primary model)
- **Group supervision:** Small group of therapists with qualified supervisor (supplementary or alternative)
- **Peer supervision:** Collaborative supervision among experienced practitioners (not replacement for formal supervision unless both parties qualified supervisors)
- **Line management supervision:** Separate from clinical supervision; focuses on performance, operational matters

**Important distinction:** Clinical supervision is separate from line management. While Clinical Director may provide both, the roles and boundaries must be clear.

## 3. Supervision Requirements and Frequency

### 3.1 Mandatory Frequency Standards

| Practitioner Level | Minimum Frequency | Format |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Trainee/Student therapist** | Fortnightly (every 2 weeks) | Individual supervision (1 hour minimum) |
| **Newly qualified (first 2 years post-qualification)** | Fortnightly (every 2 weeks) | Individual supervision (1 hour minimum) |
| **Qualified practitioner (2+ years post-qualification)** | Monthly (minimum) | Individual or group supervision (1.5 hours minimum per month) |
| **Experienced practitioner (5+ years)** | Monthly (minimum) | Individual, group, or peer supervision (1.5 hours minimum per month) |
| **Clinical supervisors** | Monthly (minimum) | Supervision of supervision (with external or peer supervisor) |

### 3.2 Supervision Ratio (Caseload)

Professional bodies recommend supervision in proportion to clinical contact hours:

- **BACP guidance:** 1.5 hours supervision per month minimum for practitioners seeing clients
- **High caseload (20+ client contact hours/week):** Consider increasing to 2 hours supervision per month
- **Complex cases or high-risk work:** Additional ad-hoc supervision as needed

### 3.3 Additional Supervision

Beyond mandatory scheduled supervision, therapists should access additional support when:

- Managing high-risk cases (suicide risk, safeguarding concerns, complex trauma)
- Experiencing ethical dilemmas or professional uncertainty
- Feeling emotionally impacted by client work
- Involved in complaints, incidents, or challenging situations
- Working with new client populations or therapeutic modalities

Therapists can request additional supervision sessions at any time. This is encouraged and will not be viewed negatively.

## 4. Supervisor Qualifications and Standards

### 4.1 Supervisor Requirements

Clinical supervisors at ClearMinds must meet the following criteria:

#### Minimum Supervisor Qualifications

- **Qualified therapist/counsellor:** Hold recognised qualification (BACP accredited, UKCP registered, or equivalent)

ClearMinds encourages supervisors to pursue professional accreditation as supervisors through:

### 4.3 Internal vs External Supervisors

ClearMinds uses both internal and external supervisors:

- **Internal supervisors:** Clinical Director and senior therapists who meet supervisor requirements
- **External supervisors:** Independent supervisors contracted to provide supervision (particularly for supervisors themselves, or for modality-specific supervision)

**Independence consideration:** Where supervisor has management responsibility for supervisee, boundaries must be clearly managed. External supervision option available if preferred.

## 5. The Supervision Contract

### 5.1 Written Supervision Agreement

Each supervision relationship must be formalised through a written supervision contract/agreement covering:

#### Supervision Contract Contents

- **Responsibilities:** Supervisor and supervisee roles and expectations
- **Boundaries:** Distinction between clinical supervision and line management
- **Confidentiality:** Limits and exceptions (safeguarding, fitness to practise, organisational requirements)
- **Records:** Who keeps records, what is documented, retention period
- **Review and evaluation:** How effectiveness of supervision will be reviewed
- **Cancellation and absence:** Notice periods, rescheduling, missed sessions
- **Ending supervision:** Process for planned or unplanned endings
