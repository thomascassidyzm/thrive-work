            <p><strong>Policy Owner:</strong> Clinical Director</p>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 2025</p>
            <p><strong>Review Date:</strong> January 2026</p>

            <p><strong>Applies To:</strong> All clinical staff, therapists, and supervisors</p>
        </div>

        <div class="policy-content">
            <h2>1. Policy Statement</h2>
            <p>ClearMinds is committed to providing high-quality, safe, and effective therapeutic services. Clinical supervision is central to this commitment, ensuring that all therapists receive regular, structured support to maintain professional standards, develop competence, and safeguard service users.</p>

            <p>This policy establishes the framework for clinical supervision at ClearMinds, ensuring compliance with professional body requirements (BACP, UKCP, NCH) and CQC expectations for clinical governance and quality assurance.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Purpose of Clinical Supervision</h4>
                <p>Clinical supervision serves three essential functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normative:</strong> Quality assurance, professional accountability, adherence to standards and ethics</li>
                    <li><strong>Formative:</strong> Professional development, skill enhancement, reflective practice</li>
                    <li><strong>Restorative:</strong> Emotional support, prevention of burnout, therapist wellbeing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Effective supervision protects service users, supports therapists, and maintains organisational quality standards.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Scope and Application</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Who Must Receive Supervision?</h3>
            <p><strong>All clinical staff</strong> providing therapy or hypnotherapy services at ClearMinds must receive regular clinical supervision, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully qualified therapists and hypnotherapists</li>
                <li>Trainee and newly qualified practitioners</li>
                <li>Supervisors themselves (receiving supervision from another qualified supervisor)</li>
                <li>Clinical Director (peer supervision or external supervision)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>No exceptions:</strong> Supervision is mandatory regardless of experience level or professional seniority.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Types of Supervision at ClearMinds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individual supervision:</strong> One-to-one sessions with designated supervisor (primary model)</li>
                <li><strong>Group supervision:</strong> Small group of therapists with qualified supervisor (supplementary or alternative)</li>
                <li><strong>Peer supervision:</strong> Collaborative supervision among experienced practitioners (not replacement for formal supervision unless both parties qualified supervisors)</li>
                <li><strong>Line management supervision:</strong> Separate from clinical supervision; focuses on performance, operational matters</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> Clinical supervision is separate from line management. While Clinical Director may provide both, the roles and boundaries must be clear.</p>

            <h2>3. Supervision Requirements and Frequency</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Mandatory Frequency Standards</h3>

            <table>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Practitioner Level</th>
                        <th>Minimum Frequency</th>

                        <td>Individual supervision (1 hour minimum)</td>

                        <td>Monthly (minimum)</td>
                        <td>Individual or group supervision (1.5 hours minimum per month)</td>

                        <td><strong>Clinical supervisors</strong></td>
                        <td>Monthly (minimum)</td>
                        <td>Supervision of supervision (with external or peer supervisor)</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>3.2 Supervision Ratio (Caseload)</h3>
            <p>Professional bodies recommend supervision in proportion to clinical contact hours:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BACP guidance:</strong> 1.5 hours supervision per month minimum for practitioners seeing clients</li>
                <li><strong>High caseload (20+ client contact hours/week):</strong> Consider increasing to 2 hours supervision per month</li>
                <li><strong>Complex cases or high-risk work:</strong> Additional ad-hoc supervision as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3 Additional Supervision</h3>
            <p>Beyond mandatory scheduled supervision, therapists should access additional support when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Managing high-risk cases (suicide risk, safeguarding concerns, complex trauma)</li>
                <li>Experiencing ethical dilemmas or professional uncertainty</li>
                <li>Feeling emotionally impacted by client work</li>
                <li>Involved in complaints, incidents, or challenging situations</li>
                <li>Working with new client populations or therapeutic modalities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Therapists can request additional supervision sessions at any time. This is encouraged and will not be viewed negatively.</p>

            <h2>4. Supervisor Qualifications and Standards</h2>

            <h3>4.1 Supervisor Requirements</h3>
            <p>Clinical supervisors at ClearMinds must meet the following criteria:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Minimum Supervisor Qualifications</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Qualified therapist/counsellor:</strong> Hold recognised qualification (BACP accredited, UKCP registered, or equivalent)</li>
                    <li><strong>Substantial clinical experience:</strong> Minimum 5 years post-qualification practice (or as per professional body requirements)</li>
                    <li><strong>Supervision training:</strong> Completed recognised supervision training course (minimum 30 hours or equivalent to Certificate level)</li>
                    <li><strong>Current practice:</strong> Maintain active clinical practice (not solely supervision)</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional registration:</strong> Current registration with professional body (BACP, UKCP, NCH)</li>
                    <li><strong>Ongoing supervision:</strong> Receive supervision for their supervision practice</li>
                    <li><strong>CPD:</strong> Engage in continuing professional development relevant to supervision</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional insurance:</strong> Hold appropriate professional indemnity insurance covering supervision</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>4.2 Supervisor Accreditation</h3>
            <p>ClearMinds encourages supervisors to pursue professional accreditation as supervisors through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>BACP Accredited Supervisor status</li>
                <li>UKCP Registered Supervisor status</li>
                <li>Equivalent recognised professional accreditation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Internal vs External Supervisors</h3>
            <p>ClearMinds uses both internal and external supervisors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal supervisors:</strong> Clinical Director and senior therapists who meet supervisor requirements</li>
                <li><strong>External supervisors:</strong> Independent supervisors contracted to provide supervision (particularly for supervisors themselves, or for modality-specific supervision)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Independence consideration:</strong> Where supervisor has management responsibility for supervisee, boundaries must be clearly managed. External supervision option available if preferred.</p>

            <h2>5. The Supervision Contract</h2>

            <h3>5.1 Written Supervision Agreement</h3>
            <p>Each supervision relationship must be formalised through a written supervision contract/agreement covering:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>Supervision Contract Contents</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Practical arrangements:</strong> Frequency, duration, location/format (in-person, video), fees (if external supervisor)</li>
                    <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Supervisor and supervisee roles and expectations</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Distinction between clinical supervision and line management</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Limits and exceptions (safeguarding, fitness to practise, organisational requirements)</li>
                    <li><strong>Records:</strong> Who keeps records, what is documented, retention period</li>
                    <li><strong>Review and evaluation:</strong> How effectiveness of supervision will be reviewed</li>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation and absence:</strong> Notice periods, rescheduling, missed sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Ending supervision:</strong> Process for planned or unplanned endings</li>
                    <li><strong>Complaints:</strong> How to raise concerns about supervision</li>
                    <li><strong>Professional frameworks:</strong> Reference to professional codes of ethics and ClearMinds policies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>5.2 Review of Supervision Arrangements</h3>
            <p>Supervision contracts and relationships should be reviewed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After initial 3 months (settling-in review)</li>
                <li>Annually (formal review and renewal of contract)</li>
                <li>When significant changes occur (role change, caseload increase, new challenges)</li>
                <li>If concerns arise from either party</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Content and Focus of Supervision</h2>

            <h3>6.1 What Should Be Discussed in Supervision?</h3>
            <p>Supervision sessions should address:</p>

            <p>CQC expects providers to demonstrate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Staff competency and suitability for role</li>
                <li>Clinical governance and quality assurance systems</li>
                <li>Supervision and support for staff</li>
                <li>Learning and continuous improvement culture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Robust clinical supervision is key evidence for CQC compliance, particularly Regulations 12 (Safe care and treatment) and 17 (Good governance).</p>

                <p>Clinical supervision is a professional requirement and an essential safeguard for service users and therapists alike. It is not a sign of weakness to need supervision ‚Äì it is a sign of professionalism, ethical practice, and commitment to quality. We all need supervision, regardless of experience. Good supervision makes good therapy possible.</p>
