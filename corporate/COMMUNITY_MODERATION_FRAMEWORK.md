## 4. Crisis Response Protocols

### 4.1 Crisis Detection

**Automated Monitoring:**
- Keyword detection (suicide, self-harm, crisis, emergency)
- AI-assisted flagging (experimental, human review required)
- Member reporting system

**Human Oversight:**
- Moderators review all flagged content within minutes
- 24/7 coverage ensures no crisis post goes unnoticed

### 4.2 Crisis Response Procedure

**Step 1: Immediate Assessment (0-5 minutes)**
- Moderator reviews post severity
- Determines if emergency services required
- Activates crisis response template

**Step 2: Direct Member Engagement (5-10 minutes)**
- Private message to member expressing concern
- Provide immediate crisis resources (Samaritans 116 123, NHS 111, 999)
- Assess member responsiveness and immediate risk

**Step 3: Ongoing Support (10 minutes - 24 hours)**
- Check in with member every 2-4 hours until safe
- Coordinate with family if member provides contact (with consent)
- Document interaction for follow-up

**Step 4: Emergency Services Escalation (if required)**
- If member discloses immediate plan/means: Encourage 999 call
- If member non-responsive + high risk: Use emergency contact info (if available)
- If family member contacts moderators: Provide crisis resources, encourage family to contact emergency services

**Step 5: Post-Crisis Follow-Up (24-72 hours)**
- Check member is safe and stabilized
- Provide ongoing community support
- Signpost to Concierge Health Advisors clinical pathway if appropriate

### 4.3 Crisis Response Templates

Moderators use **pre-approved crisis response templates** to ensure consistent, professional, and safe messaging:

**Template: Suicidal Ideation**
> "Hi [Name], I've just seen your post and I'm really concerned about you. You're not alone, and there are people who can help right now. Please reach out to:
>
> - **Samaritans:** 116 123 (24/7, free, confidential)
> - **NHS 111:** Medical advice and crisis support
> - **999:** If you're in immediate danger
>
> I'm here if you want to talk, but please speak to a trained professional who can give you the support you need right now. You matter. ❤️"

**Template: Family Member Contact**
> "Thank you for reaching out about [Name]. I can see you're worried, and I want to help. Here's what I recommend:
>
> 1. If [Name] is in immediate danger, please call 999
> 2. Encourage them to contact Samaritans (116 123) or NHS 111
> 3. I'll keep an eye on their posts and reach out privately
>
> You're doing the right thing by looking out for them. Here are some resources for you too: [family support links]"

### 4.4 Escalation to Clinical Services

For members experiencing recurring crisis or needing professional intervention:

- **Pathway 1 → 2:** Signpost to Neuro-Evaluator assessment (understand root causes)
