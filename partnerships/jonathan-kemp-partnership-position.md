THINK CLEARLY          →    FEEL BETTER         →    GET CLINICAL CARE
(SmartWisdom®)              (Clear Minds)            (Concierge Health)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Planning & organization → Digital hypnotherapy  → CQC-registered therapy
Note-taking & learning  → Stress management     → Psychiatric assessment
Problem-solving         → Community support     → ADHD diagnostics
Cognitive optimization  → Sleep & resilience    → Medical treatment
```

**Positioning:** "From thinking to feeling to healing - a complete mental health ecosystem"

## 9. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Commercial Risks:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Products don't integrate well** | Medium | High | Pilot testing Phase 2, clear boundaries, modular design |
| **Corporate sales slower than projected** | Medium | Medium | Conservative targets, B2C backup, phased rollout |
| **Book/walk don't generate expected media** | Low | Medium | Professional PR support, paid media backup, multiple activations |
| **Revenue share disputes** | Low | High | Clear contractual terms, transparent reporting, quarterly reviews |

### Operational Risks:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Brand misalignment** | Low | High | Clear brand guidelines, approval processes, steering committee oversight |
| **Customer confusion (which product for what?)** | Medium | Medium | Clear positioning, customer journey mapping, decision trees |
| **Data privacy/GDPR issues** | Low | High | Robust data sharing agreement, separate controllers, compliance review |

## 10. Alternative Partnership Models (If Full Integration Too Complex)

### **Option A: Advisory Board Role**
- Jonathan joins Thrive Advisory Board (equity or annual fee)
- SmartWisdom® remains separate, no product integration
- Provides strategic advice, media amplification, network introductions
- Lower complexity, lower revenue potential

### **Option B: Affiliate/Referral Partnership**
- Simple referral fees for customer introductions
- SmartWisdom® clients → Clear Minds/Concierge Health (Jonathan earns 10-20% recurring)
- Thrive clients → SmartWisdom® (Thrive earns 10-20%)
- Easy to implement, limited strategic value

### **Option C: Content Partnership Only**
- Jonathan creates exclusive content for Clear Minds platform
- "Finding Peace of Mind" audio course on Clear Minds
- Fee per course sold or upfront licensing fee
- No SmartWisdom® integration, limited scope

### **Option D: Walk Sponsorship Only**
- Thrive sponsors 3,000km walk (£50-100K)
- Logo placement, media mentions, brand association
- No product integration, pure marketing play
- Limited long-term strategic value

**Recommendation:** Full integration (Tier 1/2) offers greatest mutual value. Start conservative (Tier 1 bundle), prove model, scale to Tier 2 corporate programmes.

---

## 11. Financial Terms (Illustrative - To Be Negotiated)

### Revenue Share (Bundled Offerings):

**Option 1: 60/40 Split**
- Thrive: 60% (platform, fulfillment, support, compliance)
- Jonathan/SmartWisdom®: 40% (IP, content, training delivery)

**Option 2: Tiered Split**
- Consumer sales: 50/50 (simpler fulfillment)
- Corporate sales: 60/40 (Thrive-led, more overhead)

### Referral Fees (Standalone Sales):

- SmartWisdom® client → Clear Minds: 15% recurring revenue to Jonathan
- SmartWisdom® client → Concierge Health: £100 per referral to Jonathan
- Clear Minds client → SmartWisdom®: 15% first-year revenue to Thrive

### Equity Consideration (If Tier 3 JV):

- New entity capitalized with IP and cash
- Equity split: 50/50 or based on valuation of contributed assets
- Vesting schedule (4 years, 1-year cliff)
- Drag-along/tag-along rights for exit scenarios

### Minimum Guarantees (To Derisk for Jonathan):

## 14. Conversation Starters

### Opening Pitch (Casual Coffee):

*"Jonathan, I've been following your journey and SmartWisdom® with great interest. We're building something at Thrive that I think could be incredibly complementary - Clear Minds for digital wellness and Concierge Health for clinical care. I see a natural fit between cognitive performance (your expertise) and mental wellness (our focus). With your book launch and walk coming up, there might be a powerful partnership here. Would you be open to exploring what that could look like? No pressure, just a conversation between two people who care about mental health."*

### Value Proposition (Formal Meeting):

*"Here's what we're proposing: integrate SmartWisdom® with Thrive to create the UK's first complete mental health ecosystem - Think (SmartWisdom®), Feel (Clear Minds), Heal (Concierge Health). We bring 70,000 users, B2B infrastructure, and clinical credibility. You bring elite networks, media platform, and cognitive tools. Together, we can reach markets neither of us can access alone. We're thinking bundled offerings, co-branded corporate programmes, and leveraging your walk and book for massive awareness. Commercially, we'd share revenue on joint sales, protect your standalone business, and potentially create a JV if it works. What resonates? What concerns you?"*

### Addressing Potential Objections:

**"I don't want to be seen as commercializing my advocacy"**
- *"Neither do we. We see this as amplifying your mission, not exploiting it. The walk remains charitable, the book is yours. This partnership would give people practical tools to implement what you're teaching. We'd be transparent about the commercial aspect while keeping the advocacy authentic."*

**"SmartWisdom® is my baby, I don't want to lose control"**
- *"Totally understood. We're proposing a licensing model where SmartWisdom® remains 100% yours. We'd integrate it into our platform with your approval, share revenue on bundled sales, but your standalone business stays intact. You keep full creative control."*

**"I'm too busy with the walk and book to take on another project"**
- *"We'd design this around your schedule. Phase 1 is low-touch (we do the tech integration). Phase 2 amplifies what you're already doing (book launch, walk). We're not asking you to do more, just align what we both do for mutual benefit."*

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
- *"We structure this with clear exit provisions. If after 12 months it's not working, either party can exit with 90 days notice. We'd also propose a minimum guarantee so you're not taking pure commission risk. Start small, prove value, then scale."*
