# THRIVE Workplace Wellbeing Platform
## Dual Assessment System: Understanding Patterns & Addressing Current Challenges

---

## Core Innovation: Two-Layer Assessment

We identify both stable workplace patterns AND current situational challenges, providing targeted support for each.

### Layer 1: Workplace Behavioral Patterns (Stable)
- How you typically respond to feedback
- Your natural approach to deadlines and pressure
- Communication and collaboration style
- Decision-making patterns
- Stress response tendencies

### Layer 2: Current State Assessment (Temporary)
- Immediate stressors (presentation, deadline, conflict)
- Current anxiety/stress levels
- Sleep and energy impacts
- Specific workplace situations affecting wellbeing
- Acute challenges needing immediate support

---

## Assessment Structure

### Phase 1: Initial Engagement (10 questions)
- Mix of pattern and state questions
- Builds initial picture
- Shows progress toward unlock

### Phase 2: Targeted Deep Dive (10 questions)
Employee chooses focus area:
- Performance & Productivity
- Workplace Relationships
- Stress & Resilience
- Leadership & Growth

### Phase 3: Completion Round (10 questions)
- Fills gaps in both pattern and state assessment
- Unlocks initial profile at 30 questions

### Phase 4: Optional Refinement (20+ questions)
- Deeper pattern recognition
- More nuanced current state understanding
