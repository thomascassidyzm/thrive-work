## NEXT STEPS (PARKED - AWAITING CLEARMINDS.COM POLICIES)

### Priority 1: Data Governance Consistency Check
**Goal:** Ensure ClearMinds Corporate policies align with ClearMinds.com existing policies

**Action items:**
1. Review ClearMinds.com's existing policies (user to provide)
2. Compare against our corporate policies in these areas:
   - Data Protection Policy
   - Privacy Policy
   - Data Breach Response Plan
   - Information Security Policy

**Key questions:**
- Are we promising more than ClearMinds.com currently delivers?
- Are data retention periods consistent?
- Are breach response procedures aligned?
- Are privacy rights (GDPR Article 15, etc.) consistently handled?

### Priority 2: Clinical/Wellness Appropriateness
**Goal:** Ensure policies fit a "wellness platform" (not medical service)

**Policies to review:**
1. **Medical Disclaimer** (MOST CRITICAL)
   - Clear we're NOT a medical service
   - Clarify SSM partnership positioning
   - Ensure CQC positioning is correct (not registered, but following best practice)

2. **Safeguarding Adults Policy**
   - Is scope appropriate for wellness platform?
   - Do we have the right duty of care boundaries?

3. **"Clinical" terminology review**
   - Clinical Governance Framework ‚Üí Wellness Governance Framework?
   - Clinical Supervision Policy ‚Üí Practitioner Supervision Policy?
   - Check if "clinical" over-eggs our positioning

### Priority 3: Service Delivery Policies
**Policies to review:**
- Complaints Policy (48-hour acknowledgment - realistic?)
- Service Level Agreements (need to match actual delivery capability)
- AI Usage Policy (transparency about neuroindicator, chatbot, any other AI)

### Deprioritized (for now)
- ‚ùå Internal HR policies (8 policies in HR & People Management section)
- These can wait until customer-facing policies are solid

---

## KEY CONCERNS TO ADDRESS

1. **Over-promising:** Are we claiming capabilities we don't have?
2. **Consistency:** Do corporate policies match ClearMinds.com current practice?
3. **Positioning:** "Wellness platform" vs "medical service" - language needs to be precise
4. **SSM Partnership:** How to properly position this relationship in Medical Disclaimer
