## 📊 Technical Specifications

### **Neuroindicator Architecture**

**Question Bank:**
- 15 questions (5-10 minutes completion)
- Mix of 5-point scales and multiple choice
- Evidence-based (PHQ-9, GAD-7, ASRS, ISI)

**Dimensions Tracked:**
1. Crisis/safety
2. Baseline wellness
3. Stress/anxiety
4. Sleep/energy
5. Attention/focus
6. Mood regulation
7. Somatic symptoms
8. Life stressors

**Scoring Logic:**
- Probabilistic (not boolean)
- Multiple dimensions scored simultaneously
- Signal types: direct, inverse, moderate, contextual
- Thresholds: Low (0-2.5), Medium (2.5-3.5), High (3.5+)

**Outcome Routing:**
```javascript
if (crisis > 3.5) → Crisis intervention
if (baselineWellness >= 4) → You're fine
if (stressAnxiety >= 3.5) → Stress/anxiety pathway
if (moodRegulation >= 3.5) → Depression pathway
if (attentionFocus >= 3.5) → ADHD/neuroevaluation pathway
else → General wellbeing support
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### **Ethical Framework:**
1. **Safety-first** - Crisis screening at Q2 (early intervention)
2. **Balanced recommendations** - Non-commercial options prominent
3. **"You're fine" is valid** - Not just a sales funnel
4. **Transparent** - Commercial relationships clearly flagged
5. **Privacy-first** - Browser-only processing, optional email

### **Clinical Foundation:**
- Evidence-based questions (validated screening tools)
- Multi-dimensional assessment (not single-issue)
- Contextual interpretation (duration, impact, attempts)
- Appropriate escalation (GP, specialist, crisis services)

### **User Experience:**
- **Compact mobile design** - Fits on phone screen without vertical scrolling
- **Smart navigation** - Auto-progression (800ms) or manual Next button when reviewing
- **Progress bar** - Visual feedback on completion
- **Can go back and change answers** - Non-linear navigation supported
- **Clear, accessible language** - No assumptive phrasing ("if any difficulties...")
- **Professional but approachable** - Balanced tone throughout

Hi Quizzle team,

We're considering importing our mental health screening tool into your platform.
Please review the question bank and scoring logic:

File: neuroindicator-questions.txt (attached)
Live tool: https://thrive-work.vercel.app/neuroindicator.html

Key question: Can Quizzle handle probabilistic scoring across multiple dimensions
simultaneously? Or is it limited to simple linear point totals?

Let us know feasibility.

Thanks,

## 🎓 What We Learned

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Privacy-first positioning is powerful** - Minimal data collection (name + email) is a competitive advantage
2. **Transparency builds trust** - "You're fine" outcome and non-commercial options make tool credible
3. **Clinical grounding matters** - Evidence base from PHQ-9, GAD-7, ASRS gives credibility
4. **Simple is hard** - Balancing clinical accuracy with user-friendliness required careful design
5. **Gibraltar registration impacts claims** - Can't claim ICO registration or specific UK certifications

### **Technical Wins:**
- Single HTML file = maximum portability
- Probabilistic scoring > boolean logic = better personalization
- Early crisis screening = ethical design
- Browser-only processing = privacy protection
- Auto-progression + smart navigation = smooth UX

### **UX Learnings (v1.1):**
- **Mobile-first is essential** - Users need content to fit on screen without scrolling
- **Compact design ≠ cramped** - Can reduce spacing significantly while maintaining clarity
- **Smart navigation prevents frustration** - Users want to review answers without re-clicking
- **Language matters** - Assumptive phrasing ("your difficulties") alienates well users
- **GP summary detail builds confidence** - Comprehensive clinical info makes users feel taken seriously

### **Clinical Documentation Insights:**
- **GPs need actionable detail** - Vague summaries are useless for clinical decision-making
- **Context is critical** - Duration, self-help attempts, current support all inform recommendations
- **Specific test recommendations** - Listing thyroid, FBC, vitamins helps GPs act quickly
- **Crisis documentation** - Recording that resources were provided protects both parties
- **Professional formatting** - Monospace font, page numbers, proper structure signals credibility

### **Content Strategy:**
- "Guided by principles of" > "compliant with" = honest positioning
- "Data and Information Governance" > "Privacy-First" = professional framing
- "User Safety & Safeguarding" as Component 1 = clear priorities
- "If any difficulties..." > "these difficulties" = inclusive language
