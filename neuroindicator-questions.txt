OUTCOME PATHWAYS (7 possible outcomes)
==========================================

1. CRISIS INTERVENTION
   Trigger: Q2 response ≥5 OR overall crisis score >3.5
   Action: Immediate safety resources (999, Samaritans, 111, A&E)

2. BASELINE WELLNESS ("You're doing well")
   Trigger: High baseline wellness score (≥4) AND low crisis score
   Recommendations: Validation, optimization tips, optional ClearMinds/OCEAN

3. STRESS/ANXIETY PATHWAY
   Trigger: Stress/anxiety score ≥3.5 OR sleep/energy score ≥3.5
   Recommendations:
   - Try first (2-4 weeks): Sleep hygiene, caffeine reduction, breathwork, exercise, magnesium
   - Professional options: GP, ClearMinds hypnotherapy, CBT, MindFit neuroevaluation

4. MOOD/DEPRESSION PATHWAY
   Trigger: Mood regulation score ≥3.5
   Recommendations:
   - GP consultation (priority - download summary)
   - NHS Talking Therapies (IAPT)
   - SmartStartMinds (if treatment-resistant)

5. ATTENTION/FOCUS PATHWAY (ADHD indicators)
   Trigger: Attention/focus score ≥3.5
   Recommendations:
   - MindFit.Clinic neuroevaluation (recommended)
   - GP consultation (rule out medical causes)
   - Environmental strategies while awaiting assessment

6. GENERAL WELLBEING SUPPORT
   Trigger: Moderate concerns across dimensions
   Recommendations:
   - Lifestyle strategies (2-4 weeks)
   - ClearMinds, GP, NHS Talking Therapies

7. CRISIS (duplicate of #1 for comprehensive coverage)

==========================================

SCORING LOGIC
==========================================

The tool uses PROBABILISTIC SCORING across 8 dimensions:
1. Crisis/safety
2. Baseline wellness
3. Stress/anxiety
4. Sleep/energy
5. Attention/focus
6. Mood regulation
7. Somatic symptoms
8. Life stressors

Each question generates SIGNALS that contribute to multiple dimensions.

Signal Types:
- DIRECT: Higher response = higher dimension score
- INVERSE: Higher response = lower dimension score
- MODERATE: Correlated at 50% weight
- CONTEXTUAL: Depends on specific answer pattern

Thresholds:
- Low: 0-2.5 (minimal concern)
- Medium: 2.5-3.5 (moderate concern)
- High: 3.5+ (significant concern requiring intervention)

Outcome determined by highest confidence score + contextual modifiers (duration, functional impact, treatment history).

==========================================

CLINICAL EVIDENCE BASE
==========================================

Questions adapted from validated tools:
- PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire - Depression)
- GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale)
- ASRS (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale)
- ISI (Insomnia Severity Index)
- PSS (Perceived Stress Scale)
- WSAS (Work and Social Adjustment Scale)

==========================================

ETHICAL SAFEGUARDS
==========================================

1. NOT a diagnostic tool (clearly stated)
2. Crisis screening at Q2 (early intervention)
3. "You're fine" is a valid outcome (not just sales funnel)
4. Non-commercial options prominently featured
5. Commercial relationships transparently flagged
6. GP summaries provided for medical consultation
7. Privacy-first (browser-only processing)

==========================================

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR QUIZZLE
==========================================

Key Requirements:
1. Conditional logic/branching: Q2 must trigger crisis pathway immediately
2. Scoring across multiple dimensions simultaneously (not linear scoring)
3. Contextual outcome routing (not simple threshold-based)
4. PDF generation for GP summary
5. Optional email capture for results delivery

Challenges for Quizzle:
- Probabilistic scoring may be complex (most quiz tools use simple point totals)
- Multiple simultaneous dimension tracking
- Contextual modifiers (duration + impact + attempts = different recommendations)
- Dynamic outcome templates (7 variations with personalized content)

Recommendation:
If Quizzle can't handle probabilistic logic, the stand-alone HTML version may be better long-term solution. Simple Boolean logic would reduce accuracy and personalization.
